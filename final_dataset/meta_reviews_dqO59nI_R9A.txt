 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Learning on Arbitrary Graph Topologies via Predictive Coding":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm evaluating a paper titled "Learning on Arbitrary Graph Topologies via Predictive Coding". Can you provide me with a summary of the paper and the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper proposes a new framework called PC graphs, which can train on arbitrary network structures without the limitation of backpropagation. The authors analyze how this framework is applied to solve different tasks, such as classification, generation, reconstruction, and denoising. The reviews are [Review 1: This paper proposes a new framework, PC graphs, which can train on arbitrary network structures without the limitation of backpropagation. It is inspired by neuroscience and implemented by predictive coding. The authors show how to use this framework to solve different tasks, e.g., classification, generation, reconstruction, and denoising. Strengths: 1. It is very interesting to leverage biological insights to design a new training framework. 2. The authors analyze how this framework is applied to solve different tasks, and the relationships between classical neural networks, like the feedforward network. 3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. Weaknesses: 1. The theoretical analysis of PC graphs is missing, such as time complexity, speed of convergence, and so on. 2. The experiments are limited in some datasets, or qualitative. The accuracy of MNIST is ~92%, which is much lower than simple CNNs.], [Review 2: This paper presents the use of predictive coding (PC) to perform various learning and inference tasks. In particular, the paper proposes PC graphs that generalize PC to arbitrary network structures. The flexibility of PC graphs is then demonstrated experimentally using a variety of network structures and learning tasks. - Originality: While the idea of PC graphs in the paper is not new, this paper however focuses on showing how a single PC graph model can be extensively used in various ways to learn different tasks. - Quality: The PC graph model is technically valid though calling it a biologically plausible model seems slightly misleading since the existence of error nodes is biologically questionable. The claim for the flexibility of the model is well supported by the experiments on various learning settings. - Clarity: The paper is clearly written and well-organized. - Significance: While the paper does not advance state-of-the-art results, the paper clearly presents the flexibility of PC graphs in various learning tasks through experiments. However, the overall practicality/utility of the model is still hard for readers to assess since 1) the potential computational overhead of the method is only briefly illustrated in the supplementary material, which is not convincing and 2) experimental results are mostly qualitative with some quantitative comparison against a few simple baselines. Additional knowledge of its computational efficiency and demonstrated effectiveness would instill more trust into the method. The authors do not discuss the limitations and societal impact of their work.], and [Review 3: The paper describes an approach to training arbitrary neural topologies based on predictive coding (PC). The nodes of the graph corresponding to the inputs are clamped to the observed values, and the remaining nodes are trained locally to minimize the discrepancy between their value and their prediction of the value itself (which is a weighted function of the values of its neighbors). The authors describe the general principle, and then perform a few experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST showcasing how the model can be used for different applications depending on which nodes are initialised or updated. Note: see further comments to the authors for the updated evaluation.].

Meta-reviewer: Can you summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the paper based on the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Based on the reviews, the strengths of the paper include its novel approach to training neural networks using predictive coding, its flexibility in solving different tasks, and its well-written and easy-to-follow presentation. However, the reviews also mention some weaknesses, such as the lack of theoretical analysis of PC graphs, the limited experiments, and the low accuracy of the MNIST dataset.
