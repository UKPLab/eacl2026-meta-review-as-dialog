Meta-reviewer: Thank you for providing me with reviews of the paper "Assistance for Target Selection in Mobile Augmented Reality". Overall, it looks like the paper has some strengths and weaknesses, and I'd like to discuss them with you. 

Dialogue agent: Certainly. I am here to assist you in any way possible.

Meta-reviewer: First of all, Reviewer 1 seemed to be generally positive about the paper, but they also criticized it for being too incremental. Could you tell me more about this?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Reviewer 1 mentioned that the paper's work is mostly incremental and that the results presented do not go far beyond what we already knew. However, they also believed that the paper could be a great first step towards a more detailed analysis of what makes MARs different from desktops and video games. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. And Reviewer 2 seemed to have some concerns about the study design. Could you provide me with more details on this?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Reviewer 2 raised some concerns about the touch selection technique used in the user study, stating that it was a complete naive implementation. Reviewer 2 suggested that the authors should not claim touch selection in mobile AR is worse than cursor-based selection, as touch should be faster in "targeting" since the user only needs to put their finger on the screen. Additionally, Reviewer 2 was curious about factors that may affect the tested task performance from the literature, such as screen size and density. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for those details. Finally, Reviewer 3 had some questions about the paper's discussion of related work and the user study. Could you elaborate on this?

Dialogue agent: Absolutely. Reviewer 3 felt that while the paper did a good job reviewing related work in cursor-based techniques and 3D, less was discussed about the work in MAR. Reviewer 3 also raised some questions about the user study, such as how the target size was selected and whether or not participants were allowed to walk around during the evaluation. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that information. Overall, would you say that the paper is strong or weak?

Dialogue agent: Based on the three reviews, it appears that the paper has some strengths and weaknesses. While Reviewer 1 had some positive comments, they also criticized the paper for being too incremental. Reviewer 2 had concerns about the study design, and Reviewer 3 had questions about the related work and user study. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. Given all of this feedback, do you have a recommendation on whether we should accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not programmed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can suggest that you weigh the strengths and weaknesses mentioned in the reviews and consider the confidence levels of the reviewers before making a decision.
