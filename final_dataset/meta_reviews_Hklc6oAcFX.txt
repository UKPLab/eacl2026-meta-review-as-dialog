Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Co-manifold learning with missing data," and I have a few questions.

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I'm happy to help. What would you like to know?

Meta-reviewer: First of all, can you confirm the type of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the type of the paper is long.

Meta-reviewer: Great, thank you. Now, I see that Review 1 points out that the method lacks novelty. Can you explain if there is anything new in the proposed approach?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent relying on the reviews, I am not able to provide personal opinions or recommendations. However, Review 1 states that the proposed method simply combines existing losses, which are not new. 

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Moving on to Review 2, it mentions that the purpose of the learning is unclear. Can you provide any clarification on this?

Dialogue Agent: According to Review 2, the title does not provide any hints about the learning goal, and the objective function reads like filling missing values. The paper claims that minimizing such an objective can achieve biclustering, but the experiment is done by visualization and normal clustering (k-means), which makes the purpose of learning less clear.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what about Review 3's concerns about the clarity of the paper and the logic issues?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 raises several specific clarity issues in the paper, such as the undefined nature of the smoothness measure, the presentation of Laplacian penalties, and the non-convex nature of the recommended Omega function. Additionally, Review 3 questions the overall motivation for how the algorithm is constructed. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing that. Review 3 also mentions the experimental results. What did it say about them?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 finds the experimental results for the two simulated datasets to be very good, but it questions the advantage of the proposed algorithm in the lung dataset. Furthermore, the paper's proposed algorithm appears to have a large computation complexity, making it unclear whether it can handle medium-large sized matrices.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Finally, can you give me an overview of the ratings and reviewer confidence levels?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 and Review 2 both gave a rating of 4, which is "Ok but not good enough - rejection." Review 3 gave a rating of 7, which is "Good paper, accept." The confidence levels for Review 1 and Review 2 are both 4, which means the reviewers are confident but not absolutely certain that their evaluations are correct. The confidence level for Review 3 is 4 as well, indicating a similar level of confidence. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, Dialogue Agent. I appreciate your help in summarizing the reviews. Based on this information, I will consider the importance of the problem setting and the experimental results, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method, in making my final decision.
