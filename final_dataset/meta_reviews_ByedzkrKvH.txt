 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Double Neural Counterfactual Regret Minimization":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Double Neural Counterfactual Regret Minimization". Can you provide a summary of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a neural network implementation of counterfactual regret minimization, where two networks are learned: one for estimating the cumulative regret and the other for estimating a cumulative mixture policy. The authors also propose a novel MC sampling strategy that generalizes outcome and external sampling strategies. The paper is well-written and easy to read, but the reviewer has some concerns about the feasibility of using a neural network to learn cumulative quantities.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the reviewer's concerns regarding the feasibility of using a neural network to learn cumulative quantities?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the reviewer is concerned that the neural network may not be able to accurately learn cumulative quantities, as it may require two types of samples: positive examples and negative examples. The reviewer is also concerned that the network may not be trained to predict 0 or any desired initial value for a newly encountered state.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: What are the reviewer's thoughts on the proposed MC sampling strategy?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer finds the proposed MC sampling strategy to be interesting and a novel approach that generalizes outcome and external sampling strategies. However, the reviewer is concerned that the strategy may not be effective in all situations, and more research may be needed to fully understand its limitations and potential applications.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you provide any insights on how the paper could be improved?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer suggests that the paper could benefit from more extensive comparisons against other IIG methods, such as Deep Stack, and comparing on much larger IIG settings with many more states to see how the neural CFR methods hold up in the regime where they are most needed. Additionally, the reviewer raises a theoretical problem with the algorithm, specifically the issue of accumulating errors over CFR iterations, and suggests that the authors explore ways to address this issue.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary and insights. Based on the reviewer's comments, do you think the paper is acceptable or should it be rejected?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviewer's comments, the paper is marginally below acceptance threshold, with a rating of 4 out of 5. The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.
