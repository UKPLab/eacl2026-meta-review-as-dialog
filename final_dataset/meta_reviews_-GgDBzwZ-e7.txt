Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper titled "Discrete-Convex-Analysis-Based Framework for Warm-Starting Algorithms with Predictions". Can you please provide some additional information about the paper?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, I'll do my best to answer your questions. What would you like to know?

Meta-reviewer: Can you explain the main contribution of the paper and the problems it addresses?

Dialogue agent: The paper proposes a framework based on discrete convex analysis that uses predictions to improve algorithm running time via warm starting. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of the framework through improvements in weighted bipartite matching, weighted matroid intersection, discrete energy minimization, and the more general class of L/L♮-convex functions.

Meta-reviewer: How do the reviewers assess the paper's contributions?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 calls it a technically solid paper with high impact, whereas Reviewer 2 considers the paper to be a weak accept with a moderate-to-high impact. Finally, Reviewer 3 thinks it is a weak accept with a moderate-to-high impact.

Meta-reviewer: Can you provide more insights on the weaknesses of the paper and how reviewers assessed them?

Dialogue agent: According to Reviewer 2, the bounds are a significant improvement over the bounds given in prior work, but the PAC bounds require many samples for large graphs. Furthermore, while the results are interesting, the techniques used in the paper come almost directly from prior work. Reviewer 2 suggests that experiments would be compelling to show that the discrete convex analysis approach is actually a better way to approach the problem than Dinitz et al. On the other hand, Reviewer 3 thinks that the paper could benefit from a more extensive discussion of the applicability of convexity assumptions and how these contrast with other notions of convexity.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Finally, how confident are the reviewers in their assessment?

Dialogue agent: According to the confidence levels provided, Reviewer 1 is fairly confident with a confidence level of 3, Reviewer 2 is confident with a confidence level of 4, and Reviewer 3 is less confident with a confidence level of 1.
