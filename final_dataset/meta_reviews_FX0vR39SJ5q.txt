Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Isometric Transformation Invariant and Equivariant Graph Convolutional Networks" and I'm trying to decide whether to accept or reject it. Can you provide some information about the paper type and the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Hello, Meta-reviewer. The paper is a long type paper. It has three reviews, and I can provide you with a summary of each of them.

Review 1 appreciated the idea proposed in the paper to solve a critical problem in graph convolutional networks. However, it pointed out several issues, such as the lack of clarity in the method description and notation, and the conceptual differences to other equivariant neural networks. The reviewer also requested a more in-depth comparison with equivariant networks and clarification regarding the scalability of the method.

Review 2 appreciated the core idea of the paper and found it potentially strong. However, the review pointed out several weaknesses such as the lack of clarity in the methods section related to the definition of objects, missing references to critical prior works, and more experiments with coordinate-aware methods.

Review 3 appreciated the clear properties provided in the paper but raised several concerns regarding the clarity of the adjacency matrix construction, the significance of the experiment results, and the lack of real-world impact in the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews, it seems like the paper has some excellent ideas but needs improvements in the clarity of the methodology section, comparison with other methods, and significance of the experiment results.

Dialogue Agent: Yes, that is correct, Meta-reviewer. The reviews suggest that the paper has potential with some significant improvements. But, the confidence level of the reviewers is not too high.

Meta-reviewer: I see. In this case, I think I will reject the paper. The paper needs to make more significant improvements to meet the standards of our conference. Thank you for your assistance, Dialogue Agent.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, Meta-reviewer. Let me know if you need help with anything else.
