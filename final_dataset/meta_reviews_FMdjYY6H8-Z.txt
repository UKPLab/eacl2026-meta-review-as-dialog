 Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Rethinking Local Low Rank Matrix Detection: A Multiple-Filter Based Neural Network Framework". I'd like to ask some questions to help me assess its acceptability for publication in ICLR.

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I'll do my best to provide summarized answers based on the reviews.

Meta-Reviewer: Great! Let's start with the first review. The reviewer mentions that the paper is confused and hard to follow, with inconsistent mathematical notation and grammatical errors. What are your thoughts on this?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper could benefit from additional clarity and attention to detail in its presentation. The reviewer notes that the mathematical notation is inconsistent, and there are grammatical errors throughout the paper. These issues may make it difficult for readers to understand the authors' proposals and results.

Meta-Reviewer: That's a good point. What about the evaluation? The reviewer mentions that the evaluation is limited and not very supportive of the authors' claims, especially for real data. Do you have any insights on this?

Dialogue Agent: The review highlights that the experimental setup is not described appropriately, and there is a lack of quantitative measures of the claimed good performances. This may make it challenging to assess the method's applicability and value.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. And what about the second review? The reviewer mentions that the authors propose a multi-filter based neural network framework for local low-rank matrix approximation problems, but there are some issues with the algorithm's composition and the lack of theoretical study. Can you provide any additional context?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the review, the proposed method is composed of many steps, and the paper does not provide sufficient study/analysis to guarantee their performance. Additionally, the reviewer notes that the authors do not provide a discussion on the connection between MLLLR and the subspace clustering problem. These issues may limit the method's applicability and value.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on these reviews, it seems that the paper could benefit from additional attention to detail in its presentation and more extensive evaluation. Do you have any final thoughts on the paper's acceptability for publication in ICLR?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper could benefit from additional clarity and attention to detail in its presentation, as well as more extensive evaluation to support the authors' claims. Without further information, I cannot provide a final assessment of the paper's acceptability for publication in ICLR.
