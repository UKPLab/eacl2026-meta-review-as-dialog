Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today to discuss the reviews of the paper "A Siamese Neural Network for Behavioral Biometrics Authentication". I have a few questions for you to help me make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.

Dialogue agent: Of course, I'll do my best to answer your questions based on the reviews.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 1 recommends a strong accept, stating that the paper makes a relevant contribution to the field and is technically sound. However, they also suggest adding more details about the feature vector and the data splitting mechanism. Can you confirm if these points were addressed by the authors in their rebuttal?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the authors added a clear and detailed explanation of the feature vector employed, including a chart and examples, as well as clarification on the data splitting mechanism in response to Reviewer 1's suggestions during the rebuttal period.

Meta-reviewer: That's good to know. Reviewer 2, on the other hand, recommends rejection due to concerns about the novelty of the siamese network approach and the lack of comparison with other methods. Can you confirm if the authors addressed these concerns?

Dialogue agent: The authors did not provide any additional comparison or novelty beyond what was already presented in the paper, so Reviewer 2's concerns were not fully addressed.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Finally, Reviewer 3 suggests that the paper has good quality and originality, but lacks research contribution and may be more suitable for a workshop rather than a main track conference. Can you comment on this?

Dialogue agent: The authors did not address this concern directly, but it is worth noting that the paper does not propose any new network architectures or training paradigms beyond what is already established in the literature. However, the paper does introduce a novel application of the siamese network approach to behavioral biometrics authentication using sequence data, which may be of interest to the conference audience.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on the reviews and your responses, I'm inclined to accept the paper with minor revisions and suggestions for improvement. Can you please provide your confidence score on the decision?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews and the authors' responses, I'm fairly confident with a confidence score of 3 that our decision to accept the paper with minor revisions is reasonable.
