Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you tell me about the paper's contributions?

Dialogue agent: Sure. The paper proposes an approximate algorithm for mean estimation in the presence of adversarial corruption and assuming the true mean is sparse. The algorithm is poly-logarithmic in dimension and achieves list-decodable mean estimation with sample complexity linear in the sparsity and logarithmic in the dimension.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, according to the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 praises the concrete and efficient algorithm but finds the novelty not clearly explained and lacks comparison with existing algorithms. Review 2 considers the problem natural, timely, and well handled. Review 3 notes that the paper shows progress but lacks technical novelty in the design of the estimator and bounds. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 2 changed their rating to accept, and Review 3 also recommends accepting the paper. Can you tell me why?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 considered the results significant, and the limitations of the theorems were thoroughly discussed. Review 3 notes that the paper makes important progress in designing robust algorithms for sparse estimation despite the lack of technical novelty.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. Finally, can you tell me about the confidence level of the reviewers' ratings?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 had a confidence level of 2, indicating some uncertainty in their assessment. Reviewers 2 and 3 had a confidence level of 4, indicating reasonable confidence in their assessment, but not absolute certainty.
