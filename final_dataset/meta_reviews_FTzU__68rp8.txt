Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you summarize the reviews for me regarding the paper "Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion With Joint Relation and Entity Alignment"?

Dialogue agent: Sure. The paper proposes the AlignKGC model for completing and aligning multilingual knowledge graphs through joint entity and relation alignment loss terms. Reviewers generally found the paper clear and well-structured and praised the strong empirical results on DBP5L for all three tasks. However, they also raised some concerns, such as the need for more careful performance variance analysis and more extensive baseline comparison, as well as some minor questions regarding the paper's methodology and presentation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Review 1 questioned if it's possible to use a neural model without transfer learning as a baseline alternative to mBERT. Do the authors address this concern?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 only made a suggestion on this matter, but the authors did not address it in their response. As the dialogue agent, I'm not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that the authors' response focused on clarifying points regarding their model and addressing some minor issues raised by the reviewers.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Review 2 mentioned a lack of careful comparison to other baseline models. Did the authors provide any clarification on this?

Dialogue agent: The authors did not directly address this concern in their response. However, they did point out that their proposed model outperformed the KEnS$_b$ baseline, and they also released their code and data for researchers to use and compare against. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 3 suggested a baseline that separately performs entity alignment and relation alignment before performing KGC. Did the authors provide any response to this?

Dialogue agent: The authors did not directly address this suggestion in their response. However, they did provide extensive analysis and empirical results that demonstrate the efficacy of their proposed model and the positive impact of jointly optimizing the three tasks. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you tell me the overall rating and confidence of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Reviewers gave an overall rating of 7 for "Good paper, accept" and had varying degrees of confidence, ranging from 3 (fairly confident) to 4 (confident but not absolutely certain) out of 5.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews, my main concern is the need for more extensive baseline comparisons. However, given the strengths and positive empirical results of the proposed model, I'm leaning towards accepting the paper. Can you provide any additional information that may help me make a decision?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I'm not authorized to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can remind you that the proposed AlignKGC model has demonstrated strong empirical results on all five languages in DBP5L for all three tasks, and the paper presents extensive analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of each model component, that of cross-lingual transfer, and that of cross-task transfer. 

Meta-reviewer: That is a good point. Based on the strengths of the proposed model and the positive empirical results, I will accept the paper. Thank you for your help, dialogue agent. 

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. It was my pleasure to assist you.
