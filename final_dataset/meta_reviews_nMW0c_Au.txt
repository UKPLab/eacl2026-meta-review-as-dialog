 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:
Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper about online learning via algorithmic equivalence. Can you help me understand the main results and contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper studies an approximate equivalence between online gradient descent (OGD) on non-convex losses and online mirror descent (OMD) on convex reparametrizations of the losses. The main results include a regret bound of O(T^{2/3}) for OGD on non-convex losses, and a sublinear regret bound for OMD on convex losses.

Turn 2:
Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the limitations of the approach?

Dialogue Agent: The paper notes that the general theory does not cover any interesting cases, and that the examples provided in Section 3.1 are not very convincing. Additionally, the paper mentions that the strong convexity parameter c>0 of the regularizer R that is constructed, depends on the properties of q and tilde{f}, which could limit the applicability of the results.

Turn 3:
Meta-reviewer: I see. What about the technical aspects of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper is well-written and the proof approach seems natural. However, there are some minor comments, such as the need for explicit statement of the conditions for 1-strong convexity of R, and the overlap of the square of the Hessian with the nabla symbol throughout the paper.

Turn 4:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the strengths and weaknesses you've mentioned, what is your assessment of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the technical solidity and moderate-to-high impact of the paper, I would rate it as a weak accept, with a confidence level of 5. However, the limited evaluation and the need for more convincing examples and a more detailed discussion of the advantages of discrete-time online learning on reparametrized functions are some of the reasons that prevent me from giving a stronger endorsement.

Turn 5:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. I will take these considerations into account when making my final decision.
