Meta-reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, I'm the meta-reviewer for the paper "NOSE Augment: Fast and Effective Data Augmentation Without Searching." Can you summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue agent: Sure, I can help with that. There are three reviews for the paper. Review 1 is generally positive about the paper's ability to achieve competitive performance in comparison to previous augmentation search algorithms, but notes that there may not be much algorithm novelty and questions the efficiency of the proposed multi-stage approach. Review 2 expresses doubts about the results achieved by the paper, citing concerns about the generalizability of the proposed approach and questioning the main contribution of the paper. Finally, Review 3 is positive about the results, but notes that the selection method for the augmenters is not clear and suggests emphasizing the computational savings achieved by the approach.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that summary. Can you give me more information about the paper type?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper is classified as long.
