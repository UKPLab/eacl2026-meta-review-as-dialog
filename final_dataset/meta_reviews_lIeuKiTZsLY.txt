Meta-reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Latent Hierarchical Causal Structure Discovery with Rank Constraints". Can you give me more information about the paper?

Dialogue agent: Of course. The paper proposes a method for identifying the Markov equivalent class of the hierarchical latent graph structure with assumptions about the graph structure and linear relationships between variables. The method guarantees identifiability up to MEC, and produces superior results compared to nearest alternatives.

Meta-reviewer: What about the weaknesses mentioned in the first review? Is there any discussion regarding the practicality of the method in modeling observational data?

Dialogue agent: The first review raised some concerns about the usefulness of the method for observational data. The paper does not provide a detailed discussion on this aspect. The paper could benefit from additional discussions on the practicality of the method and its comparison with other methods for inferring latent structure.

Meta-reviewer: The second review mentioned the weakness in the experimental results and the insufficient study of computational aspects of the paper. Can you provide more information about the computational complexity of the method?

Dialogue agent: The second review mentioned that the efficiency of the method is not well studied, and recommended the authors to show the computational aspects of the paper. The paper does not provide a detailed discussion on the computational complexity of the method in comparison to other methods. The authors could incorporate a section on computational complexity to address this issue.

Meta-reviewer: The third review appreciates the novelty and potential usefulness of the paper but raised concerns about the writing quality and some misleading remarks and definitions. Did the authors respond to these concerns?

Dialogue agent: The third review raised some concerns about the writing quality, misleading remarks, and unclear definitions in the paper. The paper could benefit from improvements in its presentation, including explanations of concepts and references to their semantics. The authors did not provide a direct response to these concerns.

Meta-reviewer: Given the reviews, what is your recommendation regarding the paper?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, the paper appears to be technically solid with potentially useful results. However, there are weaknesses in the paper that should be addressed. The first review has a higher rating and recommends accepting the paper with minor improvements, while the second review suggests rejecting the paper due to limited evaluation. The third review has a strong accept recommendation. Therefore, it is up to your discretion to weigh the importance of the strengths and weaknesses mentioned in the reviews and make a decision.
