 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "CalFAT: Calibrated Federated Adversarial Training with Label Skewness":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "CalFAT: Calibrated Federated Adversarial Training with Label Skewness". Can you provide a summary of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a calibrated federated adversarial training (CalFAT) method to address the issue of label skewness in federated learning. The authors claim that CalFAT improves the natural and robust accuracy of the model on several benchmarked datasets.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the review process for this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has received three reviews. Review 1 praises the literature review and the novel techniques proposed by the authors. Review 2 highlights the strengths of the empirical evaluation but expresses concerns about the experiment design. Review 3 considers the technical contribution to be limited and suggests including stronger baselines in the comparison.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: What are the authors' main contributions and strengths according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: The authors' main contributions are the proposal of CalFAT and the extensive empirical evaluation on several datasets. The reviews praise the solid literature review, the novel techniques proposed, and the convincing results presented in the paper.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: What are the weaknesses and limitations of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: The reviews mention that the experiment design does not align well with the authors' arguments, and that the technical contribution is quite limited. Additionally, the reviews suggest that the considered setting of federated learning with label skewness may be of limited interest to the community.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews, how would you rate the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as "borderline accept" (rating 5). The paper has technical strengths, but the weaknesses and limitations outweigh the technical contributions.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. I will consider your summary and the reviews when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
