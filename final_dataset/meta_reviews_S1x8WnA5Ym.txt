Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "Learning Diverse Generations using Determinantal Point Processes". Based on the reviews, I have a few questions to ask the dialogue agent before making the final decision on accepting or rejecting this paper.

Dialogue agent: Sure, what can I help you with?

Meta-reviewer: Can you elaborate on the proposed method in the paper?

Dialogue agent: The paper proposes to use Generative Adversarial Networks regularized by Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) to learn diverse data space. DPP is a probabilistic model that encourages diversity between the dataset. The authors add the Generative DPP (GDPP) loss as a diversity regularizer to the original generative models to overcome mode collapse problems. The GDPP loss is a function of eigenvalues/vectors of kernels, which is generated by internal features of the discriminator. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on synthetic multi-modal data and image generation.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 has raised concerns regarding the proposed loss and its computation. Can you give me some insights into this?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 has expressed concerns over whether the GDPP loss, which uses cosine similarity, actually captures DPP properties. The authors have not clarified how to compute the eigenvalues/vectors and the time complexity involved. Review 1 also questioned whether the feature kernel being not a full rank, the loss computed all eigenvalues or only some eigenvectors. These issues are valid and should be addressed in the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 points out that there are missing references to mode collapse mitigating techniques. Can you comment on this?

Dialogue agent: Yes. Review 2 has highlighted the missing references to mode collapse mitigating techniques, which could be important in better understanding the proposed method's contributions. Review 2 also suggests splitting the experiments into two parts: one where the same setting is used as in the literature and the other where new settings are studied, and the experiments of the baseline methods are also run by the authors. This could improve the credibility of the experimental results and eventually lead to reproducibility.

Meta-reviewer: Can you shed some light on the experiments in the paper?

Dialogue agent: The paper demonstrates the proposed method's effectiveness through experiments with synthetic mult-modal data, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets. However, Review 3 points out that the results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 are not impressive or convincing enough. Review 3 has also raised concerns about the batch size used and the reconciliation of the generator and discriminator goals towards using the same set of parameters.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews, it appears that there are some concerns regarding the proposed method and its effectiveness, and the experimental evaluations could be improved. Considering the reviews, what is your recommendation?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations. However, I can point out that the confidence level of the reviewers' evaluations ranges from 4 to 5, and the rating is marginally below the acceptance threshold. The decision on whether to accept or reject the paper ultimately rests with you.
