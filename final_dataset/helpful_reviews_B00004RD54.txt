Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in purchasing Lou Reed's Rock 'n' Roll Animal (Live) but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Can you give me some more information?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. What kind of information are you looking for?

Buyer: Can you tell me what some of the reviews say about the album?

Dialogue agent:

- Just bought it in CD format, still rocks after all these years!
- A real Classic and must for a Lou Reed fan.
- I mean, for the 10 years after Van Halen 1, rock guitar was pretty much junk, a bunch of finger-tapping and mindless scale progressions that completely ignore the song. Reed, along with a stunning pair of lead guitarists, blazes through the seven songs of Rock N Roll Animal with a full, glossy sound and cohesive energy, stretching the tracks with extensive guitar duals and sparkling, improvisational riff rocking.
- Although there are quite a few noticeable mistakes during the guitar soloing, it is certainly the sublime twin guitars that steal the show and take it well outside the usual Lou Reed album. The overall effect of the album is incredible.

Buyer: That sounds good. Are there any negative reviews too?

Dialogue agent:

- This album is horrendous. The bass is pretty heavy as well, though percussion is muddied.
- This may be the best cut of Heroin all time.
- I wish I had bought this 40 years ago.
- Strangely, according to a review I read a while back, the original album did not include credits for the band - Pentti Glen (drums), Prakash John (bass), Ray Colcord (keyboards), and Dick Wagner and Steve Hunter (guitars).
- The track Lady Day rarely gets a mention, while reviewers rave on about (the excellent) Intro-Sweet Jane, Heroin, Rock and Roll, etc - all great tracks and great to play along to, but the ominous approach and the plaintive soloing in Lady Day is just stunning (even today) and all too brief.

Buyer: That's helpful. Can you provide me with your opinion on the album?

Dialogue agent: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation on the product. I'm just here to provide you with information.

Buyer: Okay, thank you. Based on the information you've provided, I think I'll go ahead and buy the album. It sounds like it has a lot of positive reviews and the guitar work is impressive. 

Dialogue agent: You're welcome. I hope you enjoy the album!
