Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today to discuss the paper "Hardness of Noise-Free Learning for Two-Hidden-Layer Neural Networks". Can you give me some background on the paper type?

Dialogue agent: Yes, of course. The type of the paper is long.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. I have some questions about the reviews provided. Review 1 mentions that the authors provide lower bounds under several assumptions/models. Can you elaborate on what those assumptions/models are?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The authors provide noise-free lower bounds in the Gaussian space for learning two hidden layer networks. They provide a super-polynomial SQ lower bound, a cryptographic lower bound under the LWR assumption, and lower bounds for the query model.

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 praises the paper, calling it a "solid theoretical work". Can you tell me more about the results and techniques used?

Dialogue agent: The authors prove statistical query lower bounds for learning polynomial-sized neural networks with two hidden layers. They also show that, under the learning with rounding with polynomial modulus cryptographic assumption, no polynomial-time algorithm can learn neural networks with two hidden layers from Gaussian examples. The paper uses a modified Danieli-Vardy transform to map a Boolean example to a Gaussian example while remaining in the realizability setup.

Meta-reviewer: And what about Review 3's weaknesses? Can you explain them to me?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 points out that the paper does not explicitly indicate the limitations of the results. For example, the paper claims to rule out almost all known approaches for provably learning neural networks, but it does not rule out the well-known approach of SGD.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that information. Based on these reviews, how would you rate the paper?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 recommends the paper for acceptance and gives a rating of 7. Review 2 strongly recommends the paper and gives a rating of 8. Review 3 recommends the paper for acceptance and gives a rating of 7.

Meta-reviewer: And how confident are the reviewers in their ratings?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 expresses a high level of confidence with a rating of 5. Review 2 is fairly confident with a rating of 3, and Review 3 is also fairly confident with a rating of 3.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on these reviews, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. However, I am a bit concerned about Review 3's weaknesses and the limitations of the results. Can you provide any additional insights on these topics?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not able to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can clarify any questions you may have about the paper or the reviews.

Meta-reviewer: Alright, thank you for your assistance. After considering the reviews and the paper, I have decided to accept it. Thank you for your help.
