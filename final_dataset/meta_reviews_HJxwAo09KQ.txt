 Sure! Here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper. The title of the paper is "Learned Optimizers that Outperform on Wall-Clock and Validation Loss." The type of the paper is long. The reviews are [Review 1: This paper tackles the problem of learning an optimizer, like "learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent" and its follow-up papers. Specifically, the authors focus on obtaining cleaner gradients from the unrolled training procedure. To do this, they use a variational optimization formulation and two different gradient estimates: one based on the reparameterization trick and one based on evolutionary strategies. The paper then uses a method from the recent RL literature to combine these two gradient estimates to obtain a variance that is upper-bounded by the minimum of the two gradients' variances. While the method for obtaining lower-variance gradients is interesting and appears useful, the application to learn optimizers is very much oversold: the paper states that the comparison is to "well-tuned hand-designed optimizers", but what that comes down to in the experiments is Adam, SGD+Momentum, and RMSProp with a very coarse grid of 11 learning rates and no regularization. The authors' proposed optimizer is just a one-layer neural net with 32 hidden units that gets as input basically all the terms that the hand-designed optimizers compute, and it has everything it needs to simply use weight decay and learning rate schedules... This is a fundamental flaw in the experimental setup...].

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm here to discuss the paper "Learned Optimizers that Outperform on Wall-Clock and Validation Loss." Can you tell me what you think about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper presents a method for "learning an optimizer" by using a variational optimization formulation and two different gradient estimates. The method is simple and clearly presented, but the experimental setup is flawed, and the authors' proposed optimizer is just a one-layer neural net with 32 hidden units that gets as input basically all the terms that the hand-designed optimizers compute.

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about what you think is flawed in the experimental setup?

Dialogue Agent: The authors compare their proposed optimizer to well-tuned hand-designed optimizers, but the experiments are only done with Adam, SGD+Momentum, and RMSProp with a very coarse grid of 11 learning rates and no regularization. This is a fundamental flaw in the experimental setup, as it is not possible to compare the proposed optimizer to well-tuned hand-designed optimizers under these conditions.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What do you think about the method proposed by the authors?

Dialogue Agent: The method proposed by the authors is interesting and appears useful, but it is not clear how scalable it is to very deep networks. The authors use a variational optimization formulation and two different gradient estimates, but it is not clear how these estimates are computed, and the authors do not provide enough detail about the implementation.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on your assessment, would you recommend accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the flaws in the experimental setup and the lack of detail in the implementation, I would recommend rejecting the paper. However, the method proposed by the authors is interesting and appears useful, and with further development and experimentation, it may be possible to address the flaws and improve the results.
