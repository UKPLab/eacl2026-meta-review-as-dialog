Decision maker: Hi there. I'm wondering if you can help me with something. I've been hearing a lot about the 'right to be forgotten' online and I'm not quite sure what to make of it. Can you provide me with some information and opinions on both sides of the debate?

Dialogue agent: Of course. The debate around the 'right to be forgotten' centers around the idea that individuals should have control over information about themselves that appears online. Proponents of the right argue that people should be able to make a request to have information removed from search engines under certain circumstances. Those against the right believe that such requests would infringe on freedom of speech and inhibit free flow of information.

Decision maker: That makes sense. Can you tell me more about the arguments for the right to be forgotten?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. Supporters of the right argue that it would give individuals more control over their personal information, as well as protect them from cyberbullying, defamation, and discrimination. They can make a request to have personal information removed from search results that are no longer relevant or accurate, hence protecting their privacy and dignity. The eminent professor Eric Posner from Chicago University Law School holds the view that every individual has the right to control and regulate information from their past.

Decision maker: What about the arguments against the right to be forgotten?

Dialogue agent: Those who are against the right argue that it would lead to censorship and erasure of important historical events. It's also argued that it would give more power to large corporations like Google, as they would be the ones responsible for removing information from their search engines. The equally eminent Professor Jonathan Zittrain believes that the right to be forgotten could be misused and the decision should be based on a case-to-case basis rather than a broad application of the right.

Decision maker: Hmm, this is a tough one. Can you help me understand where the decision-makers stand on the issue?

Dialogue agent: As a neutral dialogue agent, I cannot provide any opinions or preferences. The decision on whether or not to adopt the 'right to be forgotten' online ultimately comes down to the values and priorities of the decision-makers and the society they represent.

Decision maker: I see. Well, thank you for the information. I'll keep considering both sides of the debate before making my own decision.
