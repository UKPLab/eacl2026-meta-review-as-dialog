Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have been assigned to review the paper "An Efficient and Margin-Approaching Zero-Confidence Adversarial Attack." Can you tell me a little about the paper type?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, the paper type is long.

Meta-Reviewer: Great. Now, I have read through the reviews it received. Reviewer 1 asks why the proposed algorithm performs better than CW attack. Is this something that the paper addresses?

Dialogue Agent: The paper does not provide an opinion on the matter. The authors only presented the algorithm and its performance compared to CW attack. It is up to the meta-reviewer to evaluate the significance of the difference in performance.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Reviewer 2 made some important points on the comparison to CW and PGD attacks, and how the step sizes for PGD should be tuned for a fair comparison. Can you comment on this?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2 raises important points, and the authors provided a detailed rebuttal to their concerns. However, the authors did not include additional experiments with tuned PGD step sizes. It is up to the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of this limitation.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Lastly, Reviewer 3 questions the distinction between zero-confidence attacks and non-zero confidence attacks, and suggests testing on simpler toy problems. Can you tell me what the authors said in response?

Dialogue Agent: The authors provided a detailed rebuttal to Reviewer 3's concerns, stating that the distinction between zero-confidence attacks and non-zero confidence attacks is important in practice. However, they did not address the request to test on toy problems. It is up to the meta-reviewer to evaluate the significance of this limitation.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I am concerned about the confidence levels of the reviewers. Reviewer 1 had a confidence level of 3, while Reviewer 2 had a confidence level of 4. Reviewer 3 raised some valid concerns but ultimately rated the paper a 6. How much should I weigh these confidence levels in making my final decision?

Dialogue Agent: Confidence levels can be a helpful indicator, but the decision should ultimately be based on the content and validity of the reviews. It is up to the meta-reviewer to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the paper and make a decision based on that evaluation.
