Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for joining me today. I have reviewed the feedback from the three reviewers for the paper "Optimization on Multiple Manifolds". Based on these reviews, I will make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper. 

Dialogue Agent: I understand. Please feel free to ask any questions you have about the paper or the reviews to help make your decision.

Meta-Reviewer: One reviewer rated the paper as "good" and recommended acceptance. However, another reviewer raised numerous concerns and gave a rating of "trivial or wrong", recommending rejection. What is your take on these conflicting reviews? 

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not authorized to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can provide you with the details of each review, so you can make an informed decision. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Reviewer 1 seems to have some concerns about the empirical results. Can you speak to the algorithm's performance compared to SGD and the concern around ensuring each step is descent? 

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 noted that the proposed algorithm fuses gradient information from each manifold via correlation, and although convergence is guaranteed, the empirical results were not as good as SGD. The reviewer asked how the paper ensures that each step is descent and how the proposed algorithm's performance compares to ADMM. 

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. Reviewer 2 had many concerns about the paper's problem definitions and proposed methods. Can you describe these in more detail? 

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2 had a long list of concerns, including the paper's definition of manifolds, the proposed algorithm's precision, the theoretical results, and the statements about batch normalization. The reviewer felt that many of the definitions and results in the paper were either incorrect or incomplete. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. That certainly raises concerns about the quality of the work. Reviewer 3 also identified fundamental errors and incomplete convergence analysis. Can you describe these in more detail as well? 

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3 noted fundamental errors in the paper's definitions of manifolds and the Riemannian gradient. The reviewer also pointed out incomplete convergence analysis in Theorem 2.3, where the paper does not show that the iterates converge to the intersection of the two manifolds. The reviewer also had concerns about the discussion of the intersection of G(1, n) and St(n, 1). 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to reject the paper. However, I am also considering the confidence levels of the reviewers. Reviewer 1 was fairly confident in their evaluation, while Reviewer 2 and 3 were absolutely certain. Can you reassure me that the authors responded appropriately to the reviewers' concerns? 

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or reassurance about the authors' response to the reviews. However, I can summarize that the authors did respond to the reviewers' concerns and made revisions to the paper. However, based on the reviews so far, it seems that the revisions were not sufficient to address all the issues raised. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that information. Based on the reviews and my assessment of the confidence levels, I have decided to reject the paper. Thank you for your assistance in this process. 

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for using my services. I am glad I could assist you in making your decision.
