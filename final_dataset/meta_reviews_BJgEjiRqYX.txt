Meta-reviewer: Thank you all for your thorough reviews of this paper on A Case for Object Compositionality in Deep Generative Models of Images. Based on your evaluations, I am trying to decide whether to accept or reject this paper. Reviewer 1, you seem quite familiar with the relevant literature and have provided a detailed evaluation. You mentioned some areas where the paper could be improved, such as trying more complicated datasets and conducting deeper analysis of the results. However, you also noted that the proposed method is interesting and has some strengths, such as being able to model object-object interactions during image generation. What is your final recommendation on whether to accept or reject this paper?

Reviewer 1: I think this paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold. While the proposed method is interesting, the paper could benefit from more experimentation and analysis to strengthen its claims.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Reviewer 2, you had some concerns with this paper's novelty, motivation, and experimental design. You suggested that the paper failed to convince you in establishing the superiority of the proposed method. Do you think this paper should be accepted or rejected?

Reviewer 2: I think this paper should be rejected. While the proposed method is interesting, the paper did not adequately address some important details, such as the implementation of the attention mechanism and the observed distribution of final latent vectors. Additionally, the paper did not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing methods.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Reviewer 3, you found this paper's approach sensible and the experimental results to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method. However, you noted some weak points such as the lack of investigation into alternative network designs and unclear generalizability to more complicated scenes. What is your final recommendation on whether to accept or reject this paper?

Reviewer 3: I think this paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold. While the paper could benefit from more investigation into alternative network designs and experiments with more complicated scenes, the proposed method is interesting and the experimental results do demonstrate its advantages over existing methods.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. After considering all of your reviews, I have decided to accept this paper, but with the condition that the authors address the weaknesses and limitations identified by the reviewers in a revision. Thank you all for your thoughtful evaluations.
