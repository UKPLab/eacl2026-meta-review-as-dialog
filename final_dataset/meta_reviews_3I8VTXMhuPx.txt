Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you walk me through the reviews for "Hiding Images in Deep Probabilistic Models"?

Dialogue agent: Sure, I'd be happy to help. There are three reviews for this paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thanks. What's the type of the paper and what are the strengths and weaknesses mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue agent: The paper is a long research article. The strengths mentioned in the reviews include: the unique application of the SinGAN architecture to the problem of image hiding, the use of GAN-based networks to model the probability density of cover images, the ability to hide multiple images in one model for different receivers, and the avoidance of detection by steganalysis methods. The weaknesses mentioned include: the limited dataset of only 20 images, inadequate evaluation and comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, technical flaws, weak reproducibility, and incompletely addressed ethical considerations. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what are the ratings and confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 rated the paper 3: Reject, with a confidence level of 4. Review 2 rated the paper 5: Borderline accept, with a confidence level of 2. Review 3 rated the paper 7: Accept, with a confidence level of 3.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. What stands out to you as the most important factor in making a decision on whether to accept or reject this paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to provide an opinion or recommendation. However, it's worth weighing the importance of the weaknesses mentioned in the reviews against the strengths, and considering the confidence levels of the reviewers in making the decision. 

Meta-reviewer: Okay, that's fair. Can you tell me more about the paper's security aspects and how the authors addressed them?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 mentions that the authors evaluated the model from a security perspective using three methods. Review 1 and 3 do not specifically mention security. Would you like me to provide more information on the security aspects mentioned?

Meta-reviewer: Yes, please.

Dialogue agent: Review 2 mentions that the mapping between the secret noise (generated by the embedding key) and the secret image may not be bijective, and that it is possible to obtain the secret image with random sample. The authors randomly drew 100,000 samples from each of the 20 trained stego SinGANs to prove the possibility of secret image leakage is less than 0.001%. Review 2 also mentions that the paper performed worse than HiNet in terms of the extraction accuracy of the secret image. 

Meta-reviewer: Okay, thank you for that summary. Based on the reviews and the strengths and weaknesses you've mentioned, I think my decision is to reject this paper. Thank you for your help.

Dialogue agent: You're welcome. Please let me know if you need help with anything else.
