Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today. I have some questions regarding the reviews for the paper "Depth is More Powerful than Width with Prediction Concatenation in Deep Forest." First, can you confirm the paper's type?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper is a long paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Great. Reviewer 1 praised the paper's extension of known results about Random Forest to Deep Forest. Can you provide more information on the paper's contribution to the field?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper provides a theoretical analysis of Deep Forest and its relationship between depth and the number of trees. The paper shows that Deep Forests are consistent with a rate of $\mathcal O(1/M^2)$ where $M$ is the number of trees in the forest. The paper also extends some results from Random Forests to Deep Forests, providing theoretical justifications for known empirical claims about Deep Forests.

Meta-Reviewer: Reviewer 2 mentioned that the paper's findings may not apply to real-world problems. Can you clarify that?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2 focused on the paper's lack of experiments with popular tasks and datasets, like those in computer vision or NLP domains. However, the paper provides new results on several real-world datasets and compares them to a random forest. The author's rebuttal addressed Reviewer 2's concerns and provided evidence of performance improvements compared to the baseline deep forests. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that explanation. What is your take on Reviewer 3's comment regarding the paper's assumptions?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3 stated that some of the assumptions, particularly Assumption 2's application in real-life problems, lacked analysis and motivation. However, the paper justified its use of the assumptions for simplicity in the proofs and discussed their limitations in the paper's core.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on all three reviews and your responses, I believe this is a technically solid paper with high-to-excellent impact on the field. However, I am a bit concerned about the confidence levels of the reviewers. Can you provide any insight on this matter?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Reviewer 1's confidence level was 3, indicating that they were fairly confident with their assessment, but there might have been some parts of the paper that they did not understand. Reviewer 2's confidence level was 4, indicating that they were confident in their assessment, but there might have been some parts of the submission that they did not understand. Reviewer 3's confidence level was also 3, indicating that they were fairly confident in their assessment, but there might have been some pieces of related work that they were unfamiliar with.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for clarifying that. Based on everything we discussed, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. However, I am still unsure about the confidence levels of the reviewers. Can you provide me with any insights into the confidence levels' significance in decision-making?

Dialogue Agent: The confidence level is the reviewer's self-perceived level of confidence in their assessment. A higher confidence level indicates a higher level of certainty in their assessment. However, it is possible that the reviewers may have missed some critical parts of the submission or were not familiar with some pieces of related work, which could affect their confidence level.

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful to know. Thank you for your assistance, dialogue agent. Based on our conversation and the reviews, I will be accepting the paper.
