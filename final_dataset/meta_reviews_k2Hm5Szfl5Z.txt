Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews of the paper titled "A new framework for tensor PCA based on trace invariants," and I would like to discuss them with you before making a final decision. Can you summarize the main points of the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. Review 1 recommends accepting the paper and provides several pros, such as the interesting question it addresses and the coherence and correctness of its proofs. However, the reviewer is not convinced about the importance of the problem for the ICLR community and suggests adding more experiments on real data. Review 2 also suggests accepting the paper but points out several issues related to notation, imprecise statements, and incomplete proofs. The reviewer recommends providing more details about the experimental setup and comparing the new approach with the current literature. Finally, review 3 recommends rejecting the paper due to the lack of clear definitions and inconsistent notation, which make the paper hard to follow. The reviewer also points out some claims that are not proved, and recommends adding more details about the experimental complexity and parallelism.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, I have several questions for you. First, can you clarify the problem that the paper addresses and the proposed solution?

Dialogue Agent: The paper addresses the problem of detecting and recovering a spike signal in a tensor corrupted by a Gaussian noise tensor. The paper proposes a new framework based on trace invariants to solve the problem. The framework consists of two algorithms, a detection algorithm (Algorithm 1) and a recovery algorithm (Algorithm 2), and several phases. Algorithm 1 uses cutting an edge in the graph representation of the trace invariant to detect the spike signal, while Algorithm 2 uses the leading eigenvector of the truncated graph Laplacian to recover the signal up to a rotation. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thanks, dialogue agent. Second, can you comment on the reviewers' concerns about the notation and terminology used in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 and 3 both raise concerns about the notation and terminology used in the paper. Review 2 points out several instances where important notation is introduced without definition or background citation, which makes it hard to follow the paper's flow and results. Review 3 also notes that the inconsistent notation and unclear definitions make the paper hard to read and verify the algorithms. 

Meta-Reviewer: Third, what can you say about the reviewers' requests for more experiments on real data and more details about the experimental complexity and parallelism?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 requests more experiments with real data to support the claims of the paper and provide a detailed comparison of the methods in terms of accuracy, memory, and time. Review 2 also recommends providing more details about the experimental setup and comparing the new approach with the current literature. Finally, review 3 recommends adding more details about the experimental complexity and parallelism and trying to run the experiments in parallel. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thanks, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, I would say that the paper shows promise in solving an interesting question and has several pros and cons. However, there are also several concerns about the paper's notation and terminology, as well as the need for more experiments and details about experimental complexity and parallelism. Given these concerns, I think it would be best to accept the paper subject to major revisions, such as addressing the notation and terminology issues, adding more experiments with real data and details about experimental complexity and parallelism, and providing more complete and precise proofs. What do you think?

Dialogue Agent: I agree, meta-reviewer. Accepting the paper subject to major revisions would be the best way to address the concerns of all reviewers and improve the paper's quality and impact.
