Meta-Reviewer: Hello, can you tell me about the paper's contribution and approach?

Dialogue Agent: The paper proposes using a physics-based color augmentation method, called Planckian jitter, to counter the color-crippling effects of color jitter on self-supervised training for object classification tasks. The approach uses a realistic white balancing based on Planckian blackbody radiation, and the paper shows that combining a network trained using standard color jitter with a network using Planckian jitter performs significantly better on classification tasks that can take advantage of color information.

Meta-Reviewer: And how was the paper evaluated?

Dialogue Agent: The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach on natural and man-made datasets, such as Flowers-102, CUB-200, and CIFAR. The results show improvements in downstream classification with Planckian jitter on natural image classes. The paper also includes an ablation study and analysis of the results to support the hypothesis that Planckian jitter enables the network to more effectively use color information.

Meta-Reviewer: One of the reviewers expressed concern about the benefit of the Planckian jitter. What is your response to that?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer mentioned Fig 3, which shows a more stable result, but it seems that the testing dataset also undergoes the simulated jittering rather than a real captures of different illumination. However, the paper provides a thorough limitation section that acknowledges the need for more investigation into how much the proposed Planckian jitter improves color realism while discouraging shape discrimination. The paper also shows that Planckian jitter does not always perform the best, and might underperform by a significant margin. Nonetheless, the proposed approach has shown to be beneficial for datasets where color is an essential feature.

Meta-Reviewer: What do you think about the confidence level of each review?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the content of the reviews, Review 1 seems quite confident about its assessment, with a confidence level of 5. Review 2 is also confident, but not as certain as Review 1, with a confidence level of 4. On the other hand, Review 3 expresses more skepticism about the paper's contribution and has a lower confidence level of 4.
