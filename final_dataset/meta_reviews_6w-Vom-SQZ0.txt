Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper entitled "The Impact of Presentation Style on Human-In-The-Loop Detection of Algorithmic Bias." Based on the three reviews, I would like to ask you a few questions and get your insight on the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I am happy to answer any questions you have about the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: First, can you confirm that the paper is a long paper and that it investigates the effect of presentation style on user behaviors in reviewing algorithmic bias reports?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, that is correct. The paper is a long paper, and it investigates how different presentation styles impact users' behavior when reviewing algorithmic bias reports.

Meta-Reviewer: Reviewers 1 and 3 both recommend accepting the paper, while Reviewer 2 recommends accepting the paper with some minor improvements. Based on these reviews, do you think the paper is ready for acceptance?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations on the paper. However, I can provide information about the reviews. Reviewers 1 and 3 recommend accepting the paper, while Reviewer 2 suggests some minor improvements. It is up to you as the meta-reviewer to determine the weight of each reviewer's critique and decide whether to accept or reject the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: That's understandable. Reviewer 1 pointed out two critiques concerning the definition of "algorithmic fairness/bias" and novelty of the findings around information overload/comprehensiveness tradeoff. Can you tell me more about these issues based on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1's first critique concerns the lack of a clear definition of algorithmic fairness/bias in the paper. They suggest that the paper should focus more on how biases in the training data can result in biased system outputs, instead of focusing exclusively on the *outputs* of algorithmic systems. Reviewer 1 also mentions that the paper could do a better job articulating the novelty of the design guidelines. Specifically, they suggest adding a section in the related work on related existing data visualization and information design research.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Reviewer 2 raises concerns about the design of the interfaces used in the study, such as the lack of justification for how the interface supports different types of auditing tasks and issues with the discoverability of the "see all" option in the recommendation list interface. Can you provide more information about these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2's concerns focus on the design of the interfaces used in the study. They suggest that the interface design lacks justification about how it affords/supports different types of auditing tasks. Reviewer 2 also mentions that the highlighting feature in the visual cues interface is not salient enough, and the "see all" option in the recommendation list interface is not discoverable. Finally, they suggest that better measures on cognitive load could strengthen the study findings.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on these reviews, I can see that there are some concerns about the paper that need to be addressed. However, there is also a unanimous agreement among the reviewers that the paper is well-written, informative, and addresses an important and timely topic. Considering all this information, I have decided to accept the paper with some minor revisions. Thank you for your input, dialogue agent.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. I am glad I could help.
