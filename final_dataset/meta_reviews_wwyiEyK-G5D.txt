 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper called "REVIVE: Regional Visual Representation Matters in Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering". Can you provide a summary of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new knowledge-based visual question answering method called REVIVE, which incorporates regional visual representations to improve the performance of the model. The authors claim that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on the OK-VQA dataset.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main strengths of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the paper's main strengths are its novel approach to incorporating regional visual representations, its well-motivated design, and its positive impact on the performance of the model. The reviews also mention that the paper addresses an important weakness of previous work and provides a more in-depth discussion about bias in knowledge-based VQA.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you provide more information about the regional visual representations used in the proposed method?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The proposed method uses regional tags to retrieve better implicit knowledge using GPT-3. The regional features are used to retrieve explicit features from WikiData and serve as an additional hint to the FiD answer generator. The authors claim that this approach improves the performance of the model by incorporating more contextual information.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the main weaknesses of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the paper's main weaknesses are the lack of clarity in the experiment part and the potential negative social impact of the work. One reviewer also mentions that the paper does not provide a clear discussion about bias in knowledge-based VQA and that the experiments do not adequately address the limitations of the proposed method.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I would like to give a rating of 6: Weak Accept. The paper presents an interesting idea and addresses an important weakness of previous work, but the experiments do not adequately address the limitations of the proposed method.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback. I will make sure to provide more detailed information about the paper's strengths and weaknesses in the future.
