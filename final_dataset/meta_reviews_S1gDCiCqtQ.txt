Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper, "Learning Representations in Model-Free Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning" and have a few questions for you. 

Dialogue Agent: Of course, I am happy to assist you in any way I can. 

Meta-Reviewer: Review 1 raises some questions around the generalizability of the method. Can you provide more information about the domains where the proposed method has been tested?

Dialogue Agent: The paper evaluated the proposed method on the Atari game Montezuma’s Revenge and the four-room task. However, the success of the method on more diverse domains remains unexplored.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 2 points out that the results are not that spectacular and suggests that the method lacks a meaningful comparison with prior work. Can you provide more details on the baseline used in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper compared the proposed method with a primitive action-based method. However, the paper did not include a comparison with more recent HRL methods such as Feudal Networks. 

Meta-Reviewer: Review 3 seems to raise concerns about the clarity and novelty of the paper. Can you provide more details on the clustering method used in the paper and how it differs from prior work?

Dialogue Agent: The proposed approach uses unsupervised anomaly detection and clustering to discover subgoals. While the specific instantiation of this approach does seem to be new, the overall idea of using clustering for subgoal discovery in reinforcement learning has been explored in prior work. 

Meta-Reviewer: Given these reviews, I am still unsure whether I should accept or reject the paper. Can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 has a confidence level of 4, indicating that the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain of their evaluation. Review 2 has a confidence level of 4 as well, while Review 3 has a confidence level of 5, indicating an absolute certainty in their evaluation. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your assistance. Based on the reviews and your responses, I have decided to reject the paper. The reviewers' concerns about the generalizability, comparison with prior work, and clarity and novelty of the proposed method are too significant to overlook. 

Dialogue Agent: Understood. Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to assist you in this decision-making process.
