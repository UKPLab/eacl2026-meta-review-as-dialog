Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper titled "End-to-End Multi-Lingual Multi-Speaker Speech Recognition". Can you please provide me with a brief description of the paper, its type, and the reviews that it has received?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, certainly. The paper is a long-type paper that presents an end-to-end system for recognizing single-channel multiple-speaker speech with multiple languages. It combines existing end-to-end multi-lingual and multi-speaker techniques to achieve reasonable performance, without requiring any changes. The paper has received three reviews, two of which recommend clear rejection and one reviewer is not sure of the paper's novelty and real motivation.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the overview. Can you please elaborate on the weaknesses and strengths of the paper as noted by the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. Reviewer 1 notes that the paper lacks novelty and that the artificially created training and evaluation data are not realistic. There are also not enough analyses to explain the performance differences between the proposed end-to-end framework and a two-step framework. Reviewer 2 believes that the paper does not make any significant contributions and merely explains how to create an unrealistic database of mixed speech. Reviewer 3 thinks that the framework is not novel, and the authors have made the task harder than needed. The reviewer also thinks that more analyses are required to explain the system's capabilities accurately.

Meta-Reviewer: Interesting. Based on the reviews, what can you tell me about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. Reviewer 2 is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature. Reviewer 3 is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on your knowledge of the paper and its reviews, how confident are you in accepting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As per the reviews, the paper seems to have some significant weaknesses and lacks novelty. The confidence levels of the reviewers, especially Reviewer 2, also indicate that the paper should not be accepted. However, as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations and can only provide you with the information and reviews available.

Meta-Reviewer: I understand. Thank you for your input. I will take into account the reviews and make my final decision based on the paper's strengths and weaknesses and the confidence levels of the reviewers.
