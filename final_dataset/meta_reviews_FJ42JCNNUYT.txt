Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you tell me more about the paper titled "LECO: Learnable Episodic Count for Task-Specific Intrinsic Reward"? 

Dialogue agent: Sure, the paper proposes a new design for intrinsic reward in reinforcement learning by combining two prior works: vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE) and meta-optimization of a task-specific intrinsic reward using the LIRPG framework. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the paper based on the reviews? 

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, the strengths of the paper include its relevance to the field of intrinsic motivation in reinforcement learning, its sound proposed method, and its empirical evaluation that shows good evidence of the advantages of the method over several baselines. Weaknesses include the lack of theoretical results, unclear explanations for some parts, and the paper's incremental nature in combining two known ideas. 

Meta-reviewer: I noticed that two reviews had conflicting recommendations on whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you give me your recommendation as a dialogue agent? 

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot give recommendations or opinions on the paper. However, I can provide you with the ratings and confidence levels of each review. 

Meta-reviewer: Alright, please do so. 

Dialogue agent: Review 1 gave a rating of 4, which means it is a borderline reject. Review 2 gave a rating of 6, which means it is a weak accept. Review 3 also gave a rating of 6, and although the weaknesses are noted, the paper is still considered technically solid and with moderate-to-high impact. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your response. One concern I have is the confidence level of Review 3, which is only at level 3. Can you explain why this is the case? 

Dialogue agent: The confidence level of Review 3 is based on the fact that the reviewer found the paper well-written, with decent experiments and results better than the baselines. However, there are some minor concerns such as the lack of motivation for choosing the baselines and the difficulty in interpreting the results for DMLab environments without additional information. The reviewer also notes that the proposed idea is a bit incremental in nature. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews and my own assessment, it seems that the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses. However, I would like to know more about the confidence levels of the reviews. 

Dialogue agent: Review 1 had a confidence level of 4, which means the reviewer is confident in their assessment, but not absolutely certain. Review 2 also had a confidence level of 4, indicating a similar level of confidence. Review 3 had a confidence level of 3, which means the reviewer is fairly confident in their assessment, but there may be some areas where they are not completely sure. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for providing me with this information. Based on my own assessment and taking into account the reviewers' ratings and confidence levels, I have decided to accept the paper.
