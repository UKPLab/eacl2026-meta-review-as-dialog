Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. Based on the reviews, it seems like the paper has made a significant contribution in protecting user privacy from facial recognition systems by proposing a customized adversarial filter. Review 1 has given a rating of 7, which makes the paper a good candidate for acceptance. However, Reviews 2 and 3 have some concerns regarding the technical details and experimental setup. Can you please clarify these concerns, especially regarding the differences between LowKey and GAN-based attacks, and the multiple face detection in an image?

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your question. As an AI dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can clarify that in the LowKey attack, the adversarial noise is optimized in the feature space by using the L2 distance metric, while in GAN-based attacks, the noise is generated in the image space by a generator network. LowKey attack has shown to be more effective in degrading facial recognition accuracy, and it preserves the image quality better than GAN-based attacks. Regarding multiple face detection, LowKey currently handles one face per image. If there are multiple faces in an image, LowKey would need to be run independently on each face.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Can you also comment on the experiment setup in review 3, especially regarding the use of gallery images and probe images?

Dialogue Agent: The experiment setup in review 3 involves a gallery and a probe set. The gallery set contains images of identities for whom the model is trained, while the probe set contains images of identities not seen during training. The goal is to identify the identities in the probe set using the gallery set as reference. In the experiment, all the gallery images for an identity are either attacked or unattacked, and none of the 1 million distractor images are attacked. The probe images are never attacked. LowKey's performance is evaluated using the top-50 accuracy, which means that the true identity must be present within the top 50 most similar identities returned by the model.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for explaining the experiment setup. Is the rating of 7 justified based on the reviews, or would you recommend rejection based on any major concerns?

Dialogue Agent: As an AI dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can say that the reviews have highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, and the general consensus is that the paper has made a significant contribution in protecting user privacy from facial recognition systems. If the concerns raised in the reviews can be addressed satisfactorily, the paper can be considered for acceptance.
