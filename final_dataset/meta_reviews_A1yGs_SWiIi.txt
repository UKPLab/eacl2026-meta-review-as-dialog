 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about the paper "TransTab: Learning Transferable Tabular Transformers Across Tables":

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper called "TransTab: Learning Transferable Tabular Transformers Across Tables". Can you tell me what this paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! "TransTab" proposes a new approach to learning transferable tabular transformers across tables. The authors claim that their method can handle tables with different numbers of columns and is easier to transfer knowledge learned from different columns.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main strengths of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has several strengths. First, it introduces a novel method for learning transferable tabular transformers, which can handle tables with different numbers of columns. Second, it presents several advantages of this approach, including the ability to deal with tables that have different numbers of columns and the ability to transfer knowledge learned from different columns. Finally, the authors provide a thorough evaluation of their approach on several datasets.

Meta-reviewer: That's great. What about the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has a few weaknesses. First, the authors claim that their method can handle tables with different numbers of columns, but they only test their approach on tables with a fixed number of columns. Second, the authors do not provide a thorough comparison of their approach with existing methods for learning transferable tabular transformers. Finally, the paper assumes that the tables are matrix-like and column types are given, which limits the transferability of the method.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What about the reviewers' comments?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers have provided several comments. One reviewer notes that the authors claim that their method can handle tables with different numbers of columns, but they only test their approach on tables with a fixed number of columns. Another reviewer notes that the authors do not provide a thorough comparison of their approach with existing methods for learning transferable tabular transformers. Finally, a reviewer notes that the paper assumes that the tables are matrix-like and column types are given, which limits the transferability of the method.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the reviews, what is your recommendation for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would recommend that the authors address the limitations of their approach, such as only testing their method on tables with a fixed number of columns and assuming that the tables are matrix-like and column types are given. Additionally, the authors should provide a thorough comparison of their approach with existing methods for learning transferable tabular transformers. Finally, the authors should address the reviewers' comments and provide a more detailed evaluation of their approach on several datasets.
