 Sure, here's a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Cohen Welling bases & SO(2)-Equivariant classifiers using Tensor nonlinearity." The reviews are [Review 1:...], [Review 2:...], and [Review 3:...]. The meta-reviewer may ask follow-up questions, and their final decision involves weighing the importance of reviewer confidence.

Turn 1:
Meta-reviewer: Hi there! I'm evaluating a paper titled "Cohen Welling bases & SO(2)-Equivariant classifiers using Tensor nonlinearity." Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new approach to learning rotation-equivariant image representations using autoencoders and tensor nonlinearities. The authors claim that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the rotated MNIST dataset.

Turn 2:
Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. However, I found some parts of the paper difficult to understand. Can you help me with that?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! The paper starts by introducing the concept of Cohen-Welling bases, which are used to learn rotation-equivariant image representations. The authors then describe their proposed approach, which involves using tensor nonlinearities to learn the basis. The paper also includes experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.

Turn 3:
Meta-reviewer: I see. But I have some concerns about the experimental section. The paper only includes results on the rotated MNIST dataset, and I think it would be useful to see results on other datasets as well.

Dialogue Agent: That's a valid point. The paper does mention that their method can be applied to other datasets, such as CIFAR-10. However, the authors do not provide experimental results on these datasets.

Turn 4:
Meta-reviewer: Okay, I see. What about the technical aspects of the paper? Are there any issues with the methodology or the implementation?

Dialogue Agent: The paper does have some technical issues. For example, the authors use real representations instead of complex representations, which can make the method more complicated. Additionally, the paper does not provide a detailed description of the optimization method used, which could make it difficult for other researchers to replicate the results.

Turn 5:
Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on your summary, I think I have a good understanding of the paper's contributions and limitations. What is your final recommendation for this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and my summary, I would recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions. The paper makes an important contribution to the field of rotation-equivariant image representations, and the experimental results are promising. However, the paper does have some technical issues that need to be addressed.

Turn 6:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help! I think I have a good understanding of the paper now. I will use your summary to make my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.
