Meta-reviewer: Hello there, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reports on the paper titled "The Importance of Norm Regularization in Linear Graph Embedding: Theoretical Analysis and Empirical Demonstration." Review 1 points out some unclear points regarding the dimensions in figures 1 to 3. Can you provide more information on this?

Dialogue agent: Thank you for your question. While I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, I can confirm that Review 1's point is noted and the authors could be asked to clarify these points in their manuscript.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 2 seems to have concerns about the importance of the norm and its relation to the error rate. What is your response to those concerns?

Dialogue agent: Again, I apologize, but I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can refer to Review 2's comment that the importance of the norm is a classical concept in learning theory and that the authors may have over-emphasized its importance in this study. Review 2 also raises questions about the experimental evidence, and clarity issues that could be addressed by the authors.

Meta-reviewer: That's informative. Now, on Review 3's concerns about the practicality of the results, are there any comments or clarifications from the authors in response to these concerns?

Dialogue agent: I'm afraid I do not have access to any responses from the authors on the reviewers' comments. However, Review 3's points about the assumptions made in the linear graph embedding framework and the generalization of the analysis to non-linear frameworks are valid and may be addressed by the authors in their manuscript.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviewers' feedback, it seems that there are some points that require clarification from the authors, and there are also concerns about the importance of the norm and the practicality of the results. As a meta-reviewer, I believe that reviewer confidence is important in the decision-making process. Based on the feedback given, I have a confidence level of three for Review 1 and four for Reviews 2 and 3. Overall, I am leaning towards a rejection of this paper. However, I will wait for any additional comments or responses from the authors before coming to a final decision.
