 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I am reviewing a paper on Legendre Deep Neural Networks (LDNN) for solving Volterra-Fredholm-Hammerstein integral equations. Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors propose a new method for solving Volterra-Fredholm-Hammerstein integral equations using Legendre Deep Neural Networks (LDNN). The LDNN model combines Legendre polynomials and neural networks to approximate the solution of the integral equations.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. But I noticed that the paper lacks comparisons and ablation studies to show how their model compares to other numerical methods. Can you help me understand why the authors did not include these studies?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that their method is based on the physics-informed neural network (PINN) method proposed in [2]. However, the proposed method is not a novelty and the numerical examples are too simple. The authors could have included more comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of their method.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the pros and cons of the proposed method, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: The reviews mention that the proposed method is efficient and can perform at par or better compared to other numerical methods. However, the method lacks comparisons and ablation studies to show how it compares to other methods. Additionally, the reviews suggest that the method is not novel and the numerical examples are too simple.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I am leaning towards rejecting the paper. Can you help me understand the confidence of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers have a confidence of 4 out of 5. They are confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and the confidence of the reviewers, I will reject the paper. Can you help me understand the intuition behind the FC layers after the Legendre layer?

Dialogue Agent: The FC layers after the Legendre layer are used to improve the approximation of the solution. The intuition behind the FC layers is to use more hidden layers to improve the approximation of the solution. However, the reviews suggest that the method lacks comparisons and ablation studies to show how it compares to other methods.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. I think that the case of *why* we would be using the LDNN method instead of other more classical approaches should be made a lot stronger for the paper to be of significant contribution.

Dialogue Agent: I agree. The authors could have included more comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of their method and to show why it is better than classical methods. Additionally, the reviews suggest that the method lacks novelty and the numerical examples are too simple.
