 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Can Hybrid Geometric Scattering Networks Help Solve the Maximum Clique Problem?":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper titled "Can Hybrid Geometric Scattering Networks Help Solve the Maximum Clique Problem?" and I'd like your help in assessing its quality. Can you summarize the paper's main contributions and findings?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a novel approach to solving the maximum clique problem using a hybrid geometric scattering network. The authors claim that their method outperforms existing baselines and provides a more accurate solution. They also provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed method and its performance.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What do you think of the paper's strengths and weaknesses?

Dialogue Agent: The paper's strengths include its novel approach to solving the maximum clique problem, its ability to provide more accurate solutions, and its in-depth analysis of the proposed method. However, the paper also has some weaknesses, such as the lack of proper attribution to previous work and the limited experimental evaluation on synthetic instances.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me more about the lack of proper attribution to previous work?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors of the paper fail to properly attribute parts of their pipeline to previous work. For example, the loss function they use is similar to the one proposed in a previous paper by Karalias and Loukas, but the authors do not properly cite this work or acknowledge its contributions.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: That's concerning. What about the experimental evaluation? Do you think it's sufficient?

Dialogue Agent: The experimental evaluation is limited to synthetic instances, and the authors do not provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method's performance on real-world graphs. Additionally, the authors do not discuss the scalability of their approach or its limitations.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on your summary, I think the paper has some technical flaws and limited experimental evaluation. What's your rating and confidence level for this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the information provided, I would rate this paper as a 3 (Reject) with a confidence level of 4 (You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain). The paper has technical flaws and limited experimental evaluation, which makes it difficult to assess its impact and relevance to the field.
