Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper titled "Experience replay for continual learning". Can you tell me more about the reviews provided?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. There are three reviews in total, each providing valuable insights into the paper. Review 1 is critical of the paper's proposed method of using behavior cloning for stability promotion while claiming that it doesn't address plasticity. The reviewer suggests that several other alternatives could achieve similar results and questions the theoretical value behind behavior cloning. Review 2 is positive about the paper, but has several questions regarding the experiments. The reviewer asks about the cyclical training of tasks and requests more quantitative data to enable better comparison between the methods. Review 3 is also positive about the paper and agrees with the premise of using experience replay buffers to alleviate catastrophic forgetting. The reviewer suggests that it would have been useful to see the proposed method in a practical setting and questions the relevance of the discussion on biological mechanisms.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. Can you tell me more about the confidence ratings provided by the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Yes, certainly. Reviewer 1 is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and is very familiar with the relevant literature. Reviewers 2 and 3 are confident but not absolutely certain that their evaluations are correct.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Based on these reviews, do you think the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations regarding whether the paper should be accepted or rejected. My role is to provide information and answer questions. However, I can say that the reviews provided do not strongly suggest either acceptance or rejection of the paper. The paper seems to have some positive aspects, but also some areas where improvement is needed. Ultimately, the decision to accept or reject the paper will depend on the evaluation criteria and the importance given to the different aspects of the paper by the meta-reviewer.
