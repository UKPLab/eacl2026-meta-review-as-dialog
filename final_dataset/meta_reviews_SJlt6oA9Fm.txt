Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer assigned to decide whether to accept or reject a paper titled "Selective Convolutional Units: Improving CNNs via Channel Selectivity." Can you give me a brief summary of the paper type and its reviews?

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. Sure, the paper is a long review on Selective Convolutional Units (SCUs) and proposes a structure called a Channel Distributor (CD) and Noise Controller (NC) used to reduce and replace channels to improve CNNs. It features three reviews. Review 1 suggests that the idea is interesting but not very impressive in terms of parameter flops reduced rate. Review 2 questions the overcomplicated introduction and reviews the effectiveness of SCUs in various networks. Review 3 comments on the overcomplication and unclear motivation of re-using the same features and suggests that the approach seems over-complicated considering the modest results.

Meta-reviewer: Can you elaborate more on the reviews? Which review do you think is more reliable, and why?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 scores the paper as "marginally above acceptance threshold" with a confidence of 2, which suggests that the reviewer is willing to defend their evaluation but might have not understood some central parts of the paper. Review 2 scores the paper as "marginally below acceptance threshold" with a confidence of 3, suggesting that the reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct, particularly regarding the excessive space spent on the introductory section and the unclear optimization of the training process. Review 3 also scores the paper "marginally below acceptance threshold" with a confidence of 3, pointing out the over-complication and unclear motivation of re-using the same features.

Based on the overall scores and confidence levels, it's difficult to determine which review is more reliable. However, all the three reviews agree on some downsides of the paper, including unclear motivation, over-complication, and modest results.

Meta-reviewer: What were the results of the experiments conducted in this paper, and how convincing are they?

Dialogue agent: The paper shows the effectiveness of SCUs on different datasets and networks. However, the reviewers point out that the results are not very convincing due to their modest improvement and lower compared to state-of-the-art results on CIFAR and ImageNet. Additionally, Review 1 raises doubts on whether the SCU could accelerate the forward process on modern GPUs or mobile devices.

Meta-reviewer: Given the reviews, what is your opinion on whether this paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I can not provide opinions or recommendations, but I can provide you with information based on the reviews. The final decision is up to you, and it is recommended to carefully evaluate the reviews and make a decision based on the perceived quality of the paper.
