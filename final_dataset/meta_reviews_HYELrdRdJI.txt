Meta-reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, thank you for joining me today. I have read the reviews for the paper titled MVP-N: A Dataset and Benchmark for Real-World Multi-View Object Classification. Based on the reviews, I need more information to make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you provide me with some additional insights into the paper?

Dialogue agent: Absolutely, I would be happy to answer any questions you have.

Meta-reviewer: The first review mentioned that there is no new feature aggregation method proposed in the paper. Can you confirm this?

Dialogue agent: Yes, that is correct. The paper summarizes recent multi-view-based feature aggregation methods, but does not propose a new method.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, thanks for clarifying that. Review 3 mentioned that the paper extensively evaluates other methods and datasets. Can you give me more information on this?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper evaluates 1.4 feature aggregation and 12 soft label methods on MVP-N dataset and compares their performances with other existing datasets. It also discusses the viability of these methods in real-world deployment scenarios.

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 questioned the definition of "sufficiently informative, less informative, and uninformative" in the paper. Can you explain these terms?

Dialogue agent: The terms were used to categorize the quality of views in the dataset. Sufficiently informative views have a lot of information about the object, while uninformative views have very little information. The classification performance of the object can be affected by the inclusion of both informative and uninformative views.

Meta-reviewer: Thanks for explaining that. Review 1 mentioned that there is no detail on how to train the network. Can you tell me more about this?

Dialogue agent: The paper does not provide specific information on how to train the network, but it does state that pre-trained models were used to obtain features. The training procedures may vary depending on the specific model and features used.

Meta-reviewer: Lastly, review 3 mentioned that the clarity and quality of some technical descriptions could be improved. Can you elaborate on this?

Dialogue agent: Yes, some technical descriptions in the paper could be more clear, such as the decision to make the validation and test sets as large as they are with respect to the training set. The conclusion, societal impacts, and future work discussions could also be more extensive.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews and your answers, it seems like the paper has some strengths and weaknesses. However, the confidence levels of the reviewers are different. Can you provide me with any additional insights on this?

Dialogue agent: The confidence levels of the reviewers are based on their expertise and how well they understood the paper. As an AI, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations on whether to accept or reject the paper. However, I can tell you that the paper has a rating of 6 and 7, which are marginally above the acceptance threshold and good, respectively.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help, dialogue agent. Based on all the information I have received, I will carefully consider the importance of reviewer confidence in making my final decision.
