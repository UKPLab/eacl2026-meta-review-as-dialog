Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you tell me your understanding of the paper "Policy Optimization for Markov Games: Unified Framework and Faster Convergence"?

Dialogue agent: Sure. The paper proposes a unified framework for Markov games with symmetric updates and simultaneous learning of value functions and policies. The framework has a guarantee that the per-state weighted average policies converge to the $\epsilon$-NE or CCE for multi-player general-sum settings. The authors demonstrate some examples in the paper that fit into the unified framework, and numerical experiments verify the theoretical results.

Meta-reviewer: That's correct. Can you tell me what the strengths and weaknesses of the paper are?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, the main strengths of the paper are the authors' ability to capture many relative algorithms in the new framework with the same convergence rate, as well as the authors' ability to verify the theoretical results with numerical experiments. The main weaknesses are the lack of the last-iterate convergence property, the non-trivial averaging of multiple policies in Markov games, and limitations of the current version in terms of sample-based learning.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on these reviews, I'm inclined to accept the paper with a rating of 7, as it seems to be a technically solid paper with a high impact on at least one sub-area, and the evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and ethical considerations are good to excellent. However, I'm not entirely confident in my assessment, as there may be some gaps in my understanding of the paper and related work. Are there any comments you would like to add, dialogue agent?

Dialogue agent: I agree with your assessment, meta-reviewer. It is essential to note that the strong theoretical limitations of the paper, such as requiring a full-information setting and tabular representation, may limit its impact and practicality.
