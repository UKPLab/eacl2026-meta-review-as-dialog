Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Variational inference for diffusion modulated Cox processes". Based on these reviews, I would like to discuss whether this paper should be accepted or rejected for the conference.

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I'd be happy to discuss the reviews with you.

Meta-reviewer: Great. Let's start with the positive aspects of the paper. Reviewer 1 noted that the proposed method for variational inference is sound, and particularly appreciated the use of a neural network in finding solutions. Reviewer 2 also had positive comments, noting the well-written presentation and well-founded idea of using variational inference to approximate the smoothing posterior density. Do you agree with these comments?

Dialogue agent: Yes, both reviewers seemed to appreciate the technical soundness of the paper and found the method to be well-founded.

Meta-reviewer: That's good to hear. Moving on to the negative aspects of the reviews, Reviewer 1 had some concerns about the presentation of the paper, noting issues with notation consistency and a lack of clear definitions for certain notations. Additionally, Reviewer 1 wanted to see more examples that illustrated the advantages of the proposed diffusion modulated Cox process. Reviewer 1 also had a concern about the non-negativity of the intensity function, which the paper claims is false. What do you think about these concerns?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1's concerns about the notation and presentation style are valid, and the paper could benefit from more examples to better illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. As for the non-negativity of the intensity function, the method in the paper claims that it is non-negative, but Reviewer 1 raised a concern that the paper's claim may be false. However, I am not in a position to provide any opinion or judgment on this issue.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Moving on to Reviewer 3's comments, they had a few major concerns and some minor ones. Specifically, they were unsure about how equation (13) is a subset of equation (2) more generally, and they wanted more discussion on the impact of setting $b$ and $\sigma$ a priori. Reviewer 3 also raised a question about the link function $h$, which must be set a priori, and whether it would be possible to have an inference methodology estimating not only the drift but also $h$ (and $\sigma$) at the same time. Did you find these comments helpful?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Reviewer 3 raises some specific concerns that are worth considering. The paper could benefit from more discussion on how equation (13) is a subset of equation (2) more generally, and the impact of setting $b$ and $\sigma$ a priori could be discussed in more detail. As for the link function $h$, Reviewer 3 raises a good question about whether it would be possible to estimate both the drift and $h$ simultaneously.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input, dialogue agent. Based on the reviews, I am inclined to accept this paper. However, I am concerned about the confidence levels of the reviewers. Reviewer 1 was fairly confident in their assessment, but Reviewer 2 was only somewhat confident, and Reviewer 3's confidence level was not specified. How should we weigh these confidence levels in our decision-making process?

Dialogue agent: The confidence levels of the reviewers are certainly an important consideration. However, it's also important to note that the reviewers generally had positive comments about the paper and its contribution, and the negative comments were largely focused on relatively minor issues that could be addressed with revisions. Additionally, the paper falls just above the acceptance threshold according to Reviewer 1. As such, it would seem reasonable to accept the paper despite some variation in confidence levels among the reviewers.

Meta-reviewer: That's a good point. Ultimately, based on the reviews, I think we should accept the paper with the understanding that revisions may need to be made to address some of the issues raised by the reviewers. Thank you for your help, dialogue agent.

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. It was a pleasure to discuss this paper with you.
