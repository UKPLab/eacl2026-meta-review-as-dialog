 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Evolutionary-Neural Hybrid Agents for Architecture Search":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Evolutionary-Neural Hybrid Agents for Architecture Search". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a hybrid approach that combines evolution and reinforcement learning for efficient neural architecture search.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the mutation action learning in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper uses an RNN to guide the mutation operation, and the mutations are defined as the output of the RNN controller. The method can be viewed as a generalization of conventional evolution by replacing the handcrafted (uniform) distribution of mutations with a learned one.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the pros and cons of the proposed method according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the method has several pros, such as improving the sample efficiency of pure genetic methods and generalizing well to other domains and search spaces. However, there are also some cons, such as the lack of results on CIFAR and ImageNet, and the poor explanation of the mutation action learning.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the poor explanation of the mutation action learning?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, according to review 3, the paper does not explain how exactly the mutation action is learned, and the experiment setup is confusing. The reviewer also mentions that the conclusions based on the toy data set are not convincing and that it would be better to add comparative results on the CIFAR and Imagenet data for convenient comparisons with state-of-the-art.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I think the paper has some potential but needs more work to be convincing. Can you summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! According to the reviews, the paper has several pros and cons. The method has the potential to improve the sample efficiency of pure genetic methods and generalize well to other domains and search spaces. However, the paper lacks results on CIFAR and ImageNet, and the poor explanation of the mutation action learning is a concern. The reviews also mention that the experiment setup is confusing and that the conclusions based on the toy data set are not convincing.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews, I think the paper needs more work to be convincing. I will give it a rating of 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection.

Dialogue Agent: Understood. Thank you for the feedback!
