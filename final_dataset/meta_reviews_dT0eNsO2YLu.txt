 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Learnable Polyphase Sampling for Shift Invariant and Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Learnable Polyphase Sampling for Shift Invariant and Equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks". Can you tell me a bit about the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a learnable polyphase sampling (LPS) framework for shift invariant and equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The LPS framework generalizes the manually designed adaptive polyphase sampling layers in previous works, and introduces a learnable index-selection rule for downsampling and upsampling. The proposed framework is evaluated on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, and shows convincing results.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the main limitations of the paper are the marginal performance improvement over the existing work APS, and the lack of a thorough evaluation of the LPS framework in real cases. Additionally, some reviewers have raised concerns about the complexity of the proposed framework and the need for more detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of the LPS layers.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Review 1 suggests that the paper is technically solid and has high impact on at least one sub-area, but the motivation for the learnable polyphase sampling framework is not clear. Review 2 praises the paper's technical solidity and high impact, but notes that the contribution is limited compared to the significance of APS. Review 3 praises the paper's clarity and evaluation, but raises concerns about the complexity of the proposed framework and the need for more detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of the LPS layers.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the information you've provided, I think I have a good understanding of the paper's strengths and limitations. Can you tell me more about the confidence of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Based on the reviews, the confidence of the reviews ranges from 3 to 5, with an average rating of 4.5. This suggests that the reviews are generally positive, but some reviewers have raised concerns about the marginal performance improvement and the need for more detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of the LPS layers.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and the information you've provided, I think the paper is technically solid and has high impact, but the marginal performance improvement and the need for more detailed analysis of the mathematical properties of the LPS layers are concerns that need to be addressed. I will give the paper a rating of 6: Weak Accept, with a confidence of 3.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your decision. I will make sure to summarize the reviews and provide the information you need for your decision.
