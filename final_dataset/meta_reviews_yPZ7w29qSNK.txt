Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you tell me your thoughts on the paper entitled "Towards Video Text Visual Question Answering: Benchmark and Baseline"?

Dialogue Agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. The paper proposes a new task of Video Text Visual Question Answering (ViteVQA) and the authors build the first Multi-category Multi-frame Multi-resolution Multi-modal benchmark for ViteVQA. They also develop the first baseline method, T4-ViteVQA, for this task.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you provide some more details on the reviews that were submitted for this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes. Review 1 emphasized the novelty of the proposed task and benchmark, while also highlighting that some technical contributions lack strength. Review 2 mainly focused on the created dataset, especially the collected questions and answers. Review 3 praised the proposed dataset and acknowledged the authors' efforts, while also pointing out some limitations and weaknesses in the baseline model.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that. I noticed that review 1 rated the paper slightly below the acceptance threshold. Does this align with the other reviews?

Dialogue Agent: No, meta-reviewer. Review 2 rated the paper slightly above the acceptance threshold, while review 3 rated it as a good paper that can be accepted.

Meta-Reviewer: Very interesting. What factors do you think the meta-reviewer should consider when making the final decision?

Dialogue Agent: I think the meta-reviewer should weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in making the final decision. While review 1 may have some valid concerns, the other reviews seem to acknowledge the contribution of the proposed dataset and benchmark, which is significant. Additionally, the authors have responded to all concerns and improved the paper accordingly in the rebuttal.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your insight, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews and your input, I have decided to accept the paper.
