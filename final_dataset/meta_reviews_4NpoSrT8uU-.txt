Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the reviews. Overall, I am impressed with the paper's contributions and experimental results. However, there seem to be some concerns raised in the reviews that I would like to address before making a decision. Dialogue agent, can you provide more information regarding the concerns about lack of novelty and limitations in the downstream experiments?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The concerns about lack of novelty mainly stem from the fact that the paper builds upon previous works and combines existing techniques in new ways. However, the authors have explored the design space thoroughly and provided detailed ablations to show the effectiveness of their approach. Regarding the limitations in the downstream experiments, it is true that the paper focuses solely on multiple-choice QA tasks and it would be interesting to explore whether the model can be applied to other NLP tasks and how it can be used to improve performance on KG tasks. Additionally, it is worth noting that the CommonsenseQA dataset used in the experiments is constructed using data from ConceptNET, which may give an unfair advantage to the proposed method compared to a text-only model.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. I also noticed some concerns about the experimental results, particularly with regards to the performance on CSQA. Can you provide more information on that?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the author's reported performance on CSQA seems to be lower than the baseline methods on the leaderboard. However, the proposed method still outperforms the baseline by a significant margin. It's worth noting that the reported numbers may not be directly comparable due to differences in the experimental setup. Regardless, the concerns raised suggest that additional experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and this discussion, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I am still considering the reviewer confidence levels. Review 1 rated the paper as a strong accept with high confidence, while Review 2 rated it as a weak accept with moderate confidence. Review 3 is a borderline accept with fairly high confidence. Can you explain why there is a discrepancy in the reviewer confidence levels?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer confidence levels may vary depending on their level of expertise and familiarity with the topic. Additionally, different reviewers may have different interpretations of the paper's contributions and limitations. In this case, it seems that all reviewers agree on the technical soundness of the paper and its potential impact. However, the differences in confidence levels may reflect varying degrees of familiarity with the related work or experimental setup.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the explanation. Based on this discussion and all the reviews, I feel confident in accepting the paper. The contributions are significant, and the experimental results are promising, despite some limitations. I believe additional experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods would strengthen the paper and should be considered for future work.
