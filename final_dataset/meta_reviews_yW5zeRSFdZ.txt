 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Outlier Suppression: Pushing the Limit of Low-bit Transformer Language Models":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper titled "Outlier Suppression: Pushing the Limit of Low-bit Transformer Language Models". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a framework for outlier suppression in low-bit transformer language models, which improves their quantization accuracy. The proposed approach consists of gamma migration and token-wise clipping.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the paper has strong empirical results, with high impact on at least one sub-area, and good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, and reproducibility. The proposed approach is well motivated and the analysis and visualization are informative and well presented.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the weaknesses of the paper, as identified by the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: The reviews mention that the paper's writing could be improved, with some acronyms not introduced to the reader. Additionally, the paper's novelty is limited and the authors have not adequately addressed the limitations and pain points of their work. The negative societal impact of the work is also not addressed.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I'm considering a rating of 7: Accept, with high impact on at least one sub-area, or moderate-to-high impact on more than one areas, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations. What is your confidence level in this rating?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, my confidence level is 4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.
