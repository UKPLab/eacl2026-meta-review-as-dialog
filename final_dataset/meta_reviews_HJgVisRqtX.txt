Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I've read through the reviews for the paper SEGEN: SAMPLE-ENSEMBLE GENETIC EVOLUTIONARY NETWORK MODEL and I have some questions for you. As a basic starting point, could you tell me whether the reviewers' concerns are typical or particularly severe?

Dialogue Agent: While I can't provide my own opinion on the reviews, I can say that the concerns raised are fairly typical for reviews of this type of long paper. It's not uncommon for reviewers to have questions about certain aspects of a paper, particularly when it comes to technical details.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Review 1 seems concerned that there isn't enough detail provided on how chromosomes are defined in the evolutionary network. Can you provide any further information on this point?

Dialogue Agent: I'm afraid I can't provide any additional information beyond what has already been presented in the paper. As stated in the review, this aspect of the paper could use more explanation and clarification.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 2 raises concerns about the methodology used in the paper, particularly the combination of subsampling, generation algorithm, and ensembling. Can you provide any additional information to address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: I can't provide additional information beyond what has already been presented in the paper, but it's worth noting that the paper did compare their methodology to the original forms of LINE and DeepWalk and found improved performance. However, the reviewer does raise valid concerns about the ways in which the components are combined.

Meta-Reviewer: And finally, Review 3 raises several concerns about the claims made in the paper and the methodology used. Can you address any of these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Again, I can't provide my own opinions on the matter, but it is worth noting that the paper introduces a novel approach to building deep models using genetic algorithms, and some of the reviewer's concerns could be addressed with further experimentation and explanation. Specifically, some of the ungrounded claims made in the paper and unclear points in the methodology could benefit from further clarification and testing.
