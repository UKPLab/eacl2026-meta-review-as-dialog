Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. Overall, it seems that all three reviewers find the paper theoretically sound and interesting. However, Reviewer 2 points out some issues with the proofs and requests confirmation of their correctness. Based on this, I think we should condition acceptance of the paper on the authors addressing Reviewer 2's concerns and providing further clarification in the text as needed. 

Regarding Reviewer 1's concerns, it seems that the authors have addressed them in their response. I see no reason why we cannot accept the paper once the remaining issues pointed out by Reviewer 2 are resolved. 

What do the other reviewers think about this? 

Reviewer 2: I agree with the meta-reviewer's suggestion. I think the paper is interesting and well-written, but it is crucial that the proofs are correct. I appreciate that the authors have responded to my concerns and I look forward to seeing the revised version. 

Reviewer 3: I agree with the meta-reviewer and Reviewer 2. The issues raised by Reviewer 2 need to be addressed before acceptance. I have no further comments. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, Reviewer 3. I think we have a consensus that the paper is worth accepting, but only after the authors have addressed Reviewer 2's concerns. I will communicate this to the authors.
