Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I'm reviewing the paper titled "Conditional Inference in Pre-trained Variational Autoencoders via Cross-coding." Can you tell me more about the reviews that were submitted for this paper?

Dialogue agent: Sure, the paper received three reviews. Review 1 expressed concerns about the practicality and terminology used in the paper, while Review 2 questioned the novelty and significance of the proposed approach. Review 3 mainly discussed the technical correctness of the method and suggested some improvements.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. How would you describe the type of paper we are dealing with?

Dialogue agent: The paper is classified as "long" according to the provided information.

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. Can you provide more information about the method proposed in the paper?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, the paper proposes a way to impute missing data using pre-trained variational autoencoders (VAEs) via cross-coding. It assumes a fixed pre-trained generative model, performs variational inference to infer a posterior on latent variables given a partial image, and then uses this approximate posterior to predict missing pixels. The method uses a normalizing flow-based variational distribution and is evaluated on various datasets.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. What were the concerns raised by Review 1?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 expressed concerns about the use of confusing terminology, the evaluation methodology, and the practicality of the proposed approach. The reviewer also questioned the purpose and usefulness of performing non-autoencoding variational inference to impute missing data.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what about Review 2?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 questioned the novelty and significance of the approach and suggested that the paper failed to contextualize their work with the existing literature. The reviewer recommended against accepting the paper for publication.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. And what did Review 3 discuss?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 mainly discussed the technical correctness of the method and suggested some improvements, such as using a lower triangular matrix with strictly positive diagonal elements for computing the determinant of the covariance matrix, and using more flexible normalizing flows such as Inverse Autoregressive Flow.

Meta-reviewer: I appreciate your summary. Based on these reviews, I have to decide whether to accept or reject the paper. Given the concerns raised, I am inclined to reject the paper. However, Review 3 suggests that the method is technically correct and provides some suggestions for improvement. How confident are you in the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 and Review 2 both rated the paper with a score of 4, indicating that they are not convinced by the proposed approach and do not recommend acceptance. Review 3 rated the paper with a score of 4 as well, but expressed a higher level of confidence and familiarity with the relevant literature. The reviewer suggested some improvements but did not recommend rejection. Based on the reviews and ratings, it seems that the concerns raised by Review 1 and Review 2 are more significant than the feedback provided by Review 3.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on the reviews, I have decided to reject the paper. I appreciate your assistance in this matter.
