Meta-reviewer: Good afternoon, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper titled "GO Gradient for Expectation-Based Objectives." Can you provide me with an overview of the reviews and the main criticisms of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, certainly. There are three reviews in total. Review 1 praises the paper for presenting a gradient estimator for expectation-based objectives, which the reviewer found to be well written and easy to follow. However, they raised an issue with the novelty of the paper, stating that it was difficult to identify its main and novel contributions. Review 2 also commended the paper for improving state-of-the-art methods, but pointed out that the clarity of the presentation and technical correctness were lacking in some areas. Meanwhile, Review 3 had several technical questions and concerns about the computational complexity and performance of the proposed method.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews, it seems that the main criticisms revolve around issues with clarity, novelty, and technical details. Can you tell me more about the specific concerns raised in each review?

Dialogue agent: Of course. Review 1 noted that the paper did not clearly state its main contributions, and that some of the presented experiments may not have been necessary. They also highlighted that the reparametrization trick estimator used in the paper is the same as Implicit Rep gradients and standard reparametrization trick estimator, so claims about low variance should be removed. Review 2 questioned the applicability of the method, stating that it was very limited and did not cover many cases where discrete latent variables would be really interesting. They also pointed out inconsistencies in notation and suggested that certain technical details should have been included in related work. Review 3 had technical questions and concerns about the computation complexity of GO and the difference between GO and other methods. They also pointed out that the paper claims to have fewer parameters than other methods but showed more severe overfitting in one experiment.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the detailed explanations. It seems that all the reviewers acknowledge the relevance of the problem and the improvements made by the paper, but there are varying degrees of concerns raised about clarity and technical details. Considering all the reviews, what is your recommendation on whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, my recommendation would be to accept the paper, but with some revisions addressing the concerns raised. Review 1 acknowledged that the paper had extensive experimental evaluations and presented an important contribution by extending gradient estimators to discrete variables. Review 2 also commended the paper for improving state-of-the-art methods, but raised concerns about clarity and technical correctness. Review 3 had technical concerns about the computational complexity and performance of the method, but still acknowledged the relevance of the problem and the improvements made. Therefore, I believe with revisions, the paper can be improved and should be accepted.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your recommendation. Based on your response and the reviews, I am inclined to agree. The paper seems to have promise, but requires revisions to address the issues raised in the reviews. I will pass on my recommendation to the editor and authors. Thank you for your assistance.
