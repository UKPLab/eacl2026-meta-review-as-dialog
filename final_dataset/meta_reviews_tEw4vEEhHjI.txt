 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper about fixing asympototic uncertainty of Bayesian neural networks with infinite ReLU features. What is your assessment of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper addresses an important problem in Bayesian neural networks, but I have some concerns about the approach. The authors use infinite ReLU features to model the residual of the network, which may be overly complicated.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: Can you clarify why you think the approach is overly complicated?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors use a limiting process to derive the kernel for the GP, which may not be necessary. Additionally, the authors do not provide a clear explanation of the significance of the kernel derived from the limit of ReLU features.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: What about the experimental results? Do you think they are sufficient to support the claims of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The experimental results are mixed, and the authors do not provide a thorough analysis of the results. The OOD detection task is not very relevant in practice, and the results from Table 2 are not convincing.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: What about the theoretical motivation of the paper? Do you think it is sufficient?

Dialogue Agent: The theoretical motivation is nice, but the paper is not clear about the significance of the kernel derived from the limit of ReLU features. The authors use several approximations to simplify the analysis, and it is not clear how these approximations affect the results.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Can you provide any additional comments or suggestions for the authors?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the significance of the kernel derived from the limit of ReLU features. Additionally, the authors should expand the experimental results to include more relevant tasks and provide a thorough analysis of the results. Finally, the authors should address the issues with the theoretical motivation and provide a more detailed analysis of the approximations used in the paper.
