Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper titled "Smoothing the Geometry of Probabilistic Box Embeddings." Overall, the reviews seem positive, but I have some questions and concerns that I'd like to address before making a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you provide me with more information regarding the optimization algorithm used by the authors, the hyperparameters, and the value of sigma for diffusion?

Dialogue agent: Thank you for your question, meta-reviewer. However, as a dialogue agent, I am not authorized to provide opinions or recommendations regarding the paper or its reviews. My role is to provide factual information and clarify any misunderstandings that may arise. With that said, I can tell you that Review 1 also raised concern over the lack of details provided regarding the optimization algorithm and hyperparameters. I suggest reaching out to the authors for further information on these topics.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. I will follow up with the authors for more information on the optimization algorithm and hyperparameters. Review 1 also suggested adding graphical illustrations of the embedding. Do you have any thoughts on this suggestion?

Dialogue agent: Again, as a dialogue agent, I cannot offer opinions or recommendations. However, Review 1 did suggest that some graphical illustration of the embedding would be helpful, particularly something like Figure 2 of the paper "Probabilistic Embedding of Knowledge Graphs with Box Lattice Measures." It may be worthwhile to include such an illustration.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the suggestion, dialogue agent. Review 2 brought up some additional points of feedback, such as missing citations and comparisons. Can you provide me with more information on these points?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Review 2 did note that the paper is missing a citation/comparison to Ganea et al. 2018, which is an alternative way of generalizing order embeddings. Review 2 also raised some questions about the Gaussian relaxation (Eq. (2) and (3)), particularly in regards to the length scale sigma and its effect on the embedding space. Additionally, Review 2 asked for more information on the encoder model used for the embeddings in the Flickr dataset and how it handles unseen captions. Finally, Review 2 suggested that the paper include metrics to directly support the claim that smoothing makes training easier, such as variance under random restarts.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary, dialogue agent. It seems that Review 2 had some important questions and suggestions. I will take these into consideration when making my final decision. Moving on to Review 3, which seems to have rated the paper highly, do you have any comments or clarifications on Review 3's feedback?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 was overall positive about the paper, describing it as a "novel, theoretically well-justified idea with excellent results." However, Review 3 did note some concerns with the clarity of certain equations and definitions, such as the use of \prod in 3.3. meet and join definitions and the definition of m(x). Review 3 also suggested including an illustrating figure for convolutions in Eq. 2 and providing more information on running times and scalability.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary, dialogue agent. It seems that there were some concerns with the clarity of certain equations and definitions in the paper. Overall, do you believe that the reviews provide a clear recommendation on whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: All three reviews seem to rate the paper positively, with Review 1 giving a rating of 8 (a top 50% acceptance rate) and both Review 2 and Review 3 recommending acceptance. However, there were some concerns and suggested improvements raised by all three reviews, particularly regarding the clarity of certain parts of the paper and the lack of information on optimization methods and hyperparameters. I suggest taking these concerns into consideration when making a final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.
