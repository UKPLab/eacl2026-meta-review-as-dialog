Buyer: Hi, can you tell me about Discover Bellydance?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, what would you like to know?

Buyer: Well, I'm wondering if it's beginner-friendly. I've never tried belly dancing before.

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the DVD set is a good general introduction to belly dancing and is easy to follow for beginners. The first DVD, "Basic Dance," breaks down basic moves.

Buyer: That sounds great. Are there any extras included with the DVD set?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the DVD has some great bellydancing extras on it, including fitness bellydance examples. Additionally, there are performances under the special features that can help you get a feel for the dance.

Buyer: Hmm, that's interesting. Is there any specific technique being taught in the set?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the third DVD, "Mystic Dance," teaches veil techniques, upward and downward eights, head slides, and shoulder and arm moves.

Buyer: Okay, that sounds like a lot of moves to learn. Will I be able to learn everything on my own without a teacher?

Dialogue Agent: One of the reviews mentions that Veen and Neena's technique is excellent, but without a teacher to correct you, you might pick up some bad habits that you'll have to work hard to unlearn. However, many buyers have stated that the set is helpful even without a teacher.

Buyer: Thank you for that information. One last thing, do you think I should buy Discover Bellydance?

Dialogue Agent: I'm sorry, I cannot provide recommendations or opinions. However, based on the positive reviews and the fact that it's beginner-friendly, it may be worth considering if you're interested in learning belly dancing. Ultimately, the decision is yours.
