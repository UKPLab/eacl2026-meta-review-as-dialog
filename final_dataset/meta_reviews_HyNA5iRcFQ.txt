Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your reviews on the paper "Detecting Egregious Responses in Neural Sequence-to-sequence Models". Overall, it seems like the paper explores an important problem in sequence-to-sequence models and presents a comprehensive methodology for detecting egregious responses. However, I have some concerns regarding the paper that I need to discuss with the dialogue agent before making a final decision.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback, Meta-Reviewer. I am here to answer any questions you may have regarding the paper's reviews.

Meta-Reviewer: My first concern is with Review 1, where the reviewer questions whether the paper's methodology addresses the paper's research question accurately. What is your response to that?

Dialogue Agent: As an AI dialogue agent, I can only provide information based on what is presented in the paper. The paper's research question is clear: the authors propose an algorithm to find inputs (utterances) that trigger dialogue models to respond in an egregious manner. The methodology presented in the paper does address this research question, and the results of the experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in finding such inputs.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 2 raises some questions regarding the clarity and originality of the paper. What is your response to that?

Dialogue Agent: The paper's clarity is subjective, and the authors have taken steps to improve it by providing appendices that explain some of the technical aspects in greater detail. Regarding the originality of the paper, the authors have clearly stated how their work builds upon previous research and what distinguishes their approach. It is worth noting that the proposed algorithm can be applied to any chatbot, making it a significant contribution to the field.

Meta-Reviewer: Finally, Review 3 has some criticism regarding Section 3 of the paper and the conclusions drawn from it. What is your response to that?

Dialogue Agent: As the paper states, the purpose of Section 3 is to provide evidence that crafting egregious inputs through greedy decoding is unlikely. While the conclusions drawn from this section may be debatable, the authors present further evidence in later sections that supports their main claim. Also, the purpose of Appendix B is to provide additional evidence that the proposed algorithm can find inputs that trigger dialogue models to respond in an egregious manner. As for the suggestion to remove or move Section 3, that is up to the authors to decide.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your answers, Dialogue Agent. Based on your responses and the reviews, I have decided to accept this paper, but with some reservations. I am confident that the paper's methodology is sound and provides valuable insights into detecting egregious responses in sequence-to-sequence models. However, there are still some uncertainties and clarifications needed that could improve the paper's overall quality.
