Meta-reviewer: Hi, thank you for joining me today. I've read through the reviews for the paper "Learning Multiple Mappings: an Evaluation of Interference, Transfer, and Retention with Chorded Shortcut Buttons" and have a few questions for you. 

Dialogue agent: Good to be here. I'll do my best to answer your questions. 

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 1 raises some valid concerns, particularly about potential interference in memorization due to the order of presentation. Can you explain how the study addressed this issue? 

Dialogue agent: The paper utilized counterbalancing to ensure that each participant experienced a unique sequence for the mappings, and the data was analyzed using ANOVA to account for any possible order effects. However, there is no reporting of possible order effects in the paper, so it's a valid point for the authors to consider in future work. 

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 1 also suggests that the paper lacks a comparison to other augmentations. Can you expand upon why the authors chose the specific augmentation of three buttons at the side, and if there is prior research to support this choice? 

Dialogue agent: The paper does not provide a clear rationale for the specific choice of this augmentation. However, the related work section does suggest that this type of chorded input has been previously explored by other researchers. The paper primarily focused on evaluating the proposed design and prototype, rather than comparing it to other forms of augmentation. 

Meta-reviewer: Finally, Reviewer 2 identifies the lack of a baseline and concerns about the accuracy of the proposed method. Can you discuss the implementation of the proposed technique and how it compares to existing ways users select items from a set? 

Dialogue agent: The paper did not include a comparison to a baseline, which is a valid critique. However, the authors did report accuracy rates for the proposed method, which reached 90%. While this means that users may still make errors when selecting items, it may be an acceptable tradeoff for some users who value the increased speed and expressiveness of the chorded input. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews and your explanations, I believe this paper has potential and should be accepted with minor clarifications. My confidence level is a 4/5.
