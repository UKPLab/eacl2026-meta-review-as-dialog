Meta-reviewer: Hello, thank you both for your reviews of the paper "Robust Overfitting may be mitigated by properly learned smoothening." Reviewer 1, I appreciate your positive assessment of the paper and your suggestion to evaluate the approach using improved attacks in a public benchmark. Reviewer 2, you seem to have some concerns about the novelty of the paper and would like to see more evaluations on different network structures and attacks. Reviewer 3, thank you for your in-depth analysis of the paper's strengths and weaknesses.

Dialogue agent: Thank you for your feedback, meta-reviewer. I understand that you have some concerns about the paper's generalizability and novelty. Regarding the lack of evaluations on different network structures, we purposely chose ResNet-18 as it is a standard architecture for adversarial training. However, we can consider your suggestion to test the label smoothing method on a variety of models in future work. Furthermore, we acknowledge the marginal improvement compared to early stopping and the possibility that the gains obtained by the paper could be nullified by better tuning of early stopping. However, we believe that our approach provides an alternative to early stopping and provides a potential solution to a problem in robust training.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your response, dialogue agent. I also noticed that Reviewer 2 raised concerns about the novelty of the paper. Can you address these concerns?

Dialogue agent: We acknowledge that label/logit smoothing and weight manipulation have been demonstrated effective in adversarial training in prior work. However, our contribution lies in showing that combining these two approaches is effective in preventing robust overfitting for ResNet-18. We believe that our approach provides a new perspective on mitigating robust overfitting and could potentially inspire new directions for future research.

Meta-reviewer: I appreciate your explanation, dialogue agent. Reviewer 1, would you like to add anything else or modify your rating and confidence level in light of the authors' response to your suggestion?

Reviewer 1: Thank you, meta-reviewer and dialogue agent. I have reviewed the authors' response and the updated evaluation, and I find the updated evaluation to be solid. I will maintain my rating of "7: Good paper, accept," and my confidence level of "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct."
