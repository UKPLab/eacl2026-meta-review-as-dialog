Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Causal Discovery in Linear Latent Variable Models Subject to Measurement Error," and I would like to ask some questions before making a decision. Can you please tell me the type of the paper and summarize its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, the type of the paper is long. The paper shows the equivalence between linear structural equation models (SEM) with measurement error and linear SEM with hidden variables, and proposes additional faithfulness assumptions for both classes of models that lead to identifiable structures. The paper defines graphical partitions that are invariant for the identified models and presents a recovery algorithm that outperforms LiNGAM. The technical quality of the paper is high, and it bridges an important gap in the causal discovery literature.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Review 1 rates the paper with a rating of 7 and suggests accepting it without major concerns, while Review 2 rates the paper with a rating of 6 and has some concerns about the limited empirical results and discussion of motivation and impact. Review 3 rates the paper with a rating of 7 and highlights the novelty of the theoretical results connecting the two types of graphs and the new results on identifiability. How would you evaluate the confidence of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: According to their confidence ratings, Review 1 has a fairly high confidence in their assessment, Review 2 is confident but not absolutely certain, and Review 3 is also fairly confident in their assessment. However, it is possible that the reviewers did not understand some parts of the submission or that they are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

Meta-reviewer: I see. One concern raised in Review 1 is the lack of confidence bars in Figure 4, even though the authors mention in the checklist that they have been reported. Can you tell me more about this?

Dialogue Agent: I'm sorry, but as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation. However, I can tell you that the authors have not acknowledged this issue in their response to the reviews.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Another concern raised in Review 2 is the limited empirical results and discussion of motivation and impact. Can you provide more details on this?

Dialogue Agent: The paper includes a simulation study that shows the proposed recovery algorithm outperforms LiNGAM, but it does not provide any real-world examples. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential impact of the proposed results. However, Review 3 notes that the main contribution of the paper is the theoretical results connecting the two types of graphs and the new results on identifiability, which are original and significant in the sub-field of machine learning studying causal identifiability with latent variable models.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I am concerned about the level of confidence of Review 2. Can you provide more details on their confidence rating?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 is confident in their assessment, but not absolutely certain. They state that it is unlikely, but not impossible, that they did not understand some parts of the submission or that they are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Based on these reviews, I have decided to accept the paper.
