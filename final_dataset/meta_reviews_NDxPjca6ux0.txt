 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Facial Composite Generation with Iterative Human Feedback":

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Facial Composite Generation with Iterative Human Feedback". Can you help me understand the key contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a human-AI collaborative system to reconstruct the user's mental image about another person's face using eye gaze data. The system does not require prior knowledge of the target face and only relies on implicit behavioral cues. The authors claim that their approach outperforms the baseline in terms of reconstruction accuracy.

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main strengths and weaknesses of the paper, in your opinion?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has several strengths, including a well-motivated approach, relevant prior work, and a novel feature selection strategy that mimics gaze-based feature selection. The authors also provide a comparative study to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. However, the methodology is unclear, and there are inconsistencies in the information flow through the model. Additionally, the algorithm for the selection layer is difficult to understand, and the information flow through the projection layer and GRU is hard to follow.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the reviews, do you think the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper has mixed ratings. Review 1 recommends acceptance with a high confidence level, while Review 2 suggests rejection with a moderate confidence level. Review 3 recommends acceptance with a high confidence level. Overall, the paper seems to have some strengths and weaknesses, and the final decision may depend on the importance of reviewer confidence.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your input. I will consider the reviews and your summary when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
