 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Asymmetric Temperature Scaling Makes Larger Networks Teach Well Again":

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Asymmetric Temperature Scaling Makes Larger Networks Teach Well Again". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! Based on the reviews, the paper proposes a novel method called Asymmetric Temperature Scaling (ATS) to improve the efficacy of teacher networks in knowledge distillation. The authors suggest that the traditional temperature scaling method can be improved by setting different temperature values for the correct class and wrong class logits, which can lead to more informative and confident logits.

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to Review 1, the paper has a strong motivation and treats an interesting and relevant problem. However, the reviewer is concerned about the mathematical basis of the proposed method being ill-defined and shaky. Review 2 praises the paper's novelty and the authors' effort to revisit the phenomenon in knowledge distillation. However, the reviewer suggests that the experimental part could be improved, and some introduction about the compared methods should be put in the main content. Review 3 agrees that the paper studies a commonly ignored problem in knowledge distillation, but the reviewer is concerned about the significance of the contribution for the proposed method.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. How do the reviews rate the paper's technical solidity and impact?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper is technically solid and has a moderate-to-high impact. However, the reviews also mention some concerns about the mathematical basis of the proposed method and the experimental part.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews, I think I have a good understanding of the paper's contributions and limitations. I will now make my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you have any further questions or need any more information.
