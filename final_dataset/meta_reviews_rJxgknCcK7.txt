Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the thorough reviews. It seems that Reviewer 1 is generally positive about the paper, while Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 both raise questions and concerns. Reviewer 2 seems to think that while the idea of using Hutchinson's trace estimator is a valid contribution, the paper lacks comparisons to competing methods and does not give enough information on the efficiency and practical use of FFJORD. Reviewer 3 raises some technical questions about the bottleneck trick and the use of a single random vector in the algorithm.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Regarding Reviewer 2's concerns about comparisons and efficiency, the paper does compare FFJORD with other methods in the experiments section and discusses the runtime on GPUs compared to CPUs. However, we acknowledge that more details on the efficiency could have been included and we will try to address this in the final version of the paper. As for Reviewer 3's technical questions, the bottleneck trick is intended to reduce the variance of the estimator, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated in experiments. The vector epsilon in Algorithm 1 is different at each step and is randomly generated at each step, not reused.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for addressing the questions. Are there any other concerns or questions that you would like to raise before making a final decision on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: No, we believe we have addressed all the concerns raised by the reviewers. We would just like to emphasize that FFJORD enables the use of deeper neural networks in continuous normalizing flows, which can be advantageous in certain applications. Additionally, the unbiased estimator of the likelihood using Hutchinson's trace estimator is a valid contribution that can improve the computational efficiency of the method. We hope that the significance of these contributions is reflected in the final decision on the paper.
