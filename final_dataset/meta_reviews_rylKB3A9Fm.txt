 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper on assessing generalization in deep reinforcement learning. Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new benchmark for studying generalization in deep RL, which includes several standard RL tasks and a set of benchmark results. The authors also evaluate popular methodologies on this benchmark and provide a thorough study of their performance.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting, but I'm not convinced that the proposed benchmark is necessary. Can you tell me more about the motivation behind the choice of tasks and the distributions of parameters?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The authors choose the tasks based on their relevance to real-world applications and the need for generalization in deep RL. They also use a variety of parameter distributions to test the algorithms' ability to generalize. However, some reviewers have questioned the arbitrariness of these choices and the lack of new insights provided by the baseline results.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: I see. Well, I think the paper could benefit from a clearer justification of the benchmark and its significance. Can you provide any information on the related work in the field?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper mentions related work in the field, including the human starts evaluation condition for Atari games introduced by Nair et al. The authors also discuss the limitations of existing benchmarks and how their proposed benchmark addresses these issues. However, some reviewers have pointed out that the paper does not provide a compelling argument for why their benchmark is necessary or how it differs from existing benchmarks.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I think the paper has some strengths but also some weaknesses that need to be addressed. Can you provide any final thoughts or suggestions for the authors?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Based on the reviews, the authors could consider addressing the arbitrariness of the choice of tasks and parameter distributions, providing a clearer justification of the benchmark, and discussing the relationship between their proposed benchmark and existing benchmarks in the field. Additionally, the authors may want to consider addressing the poor performance of RL^2-A2C, which some reviewers have found worrisome.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help! Based on the reviews and our conversation, I will give the paper a rating of 3: Clear rejection, with a confidence level of 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature.
