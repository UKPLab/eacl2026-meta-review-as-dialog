 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "DELTA: DEEP LEARNING TRANSFER USING FEATURE MAP WITH ATTENTION FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "DELTA: DEEP LEARNING TRANSFER USING FEATURE MAP WITH ATTENTION FOR CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS". Can you tell me what this paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper describes a new technique for transfer learning in deep neural networks called DELTA, which stands for "Deep Learning Transfer using feature map with attention". The authors propose modifying the weights of the outer layers of the target network to transfer knowledge from the source network.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The main contributions of the paper are the introduction of the DELTA technique, which improves upon existing transfer learning methods, and the use of an attention mechanism to model the difference between the feature maps of the source and target networks.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me more about the DELTA technique? How does it work?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The DELTA technique involves modifying the weights of the outer layers of the target network to transfer knowledge from the source network. The authors use a loss function that incorporates the attention mechanism to ensure that the behavior of the target network is regularized.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: I see. What are the results of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The results show that the DELTA technique improves upon existing transfer learning methods, particularly when used with attention. The authors present qualitative examples in Figure 4 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: That's good to hear. What are the limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The limitations of the paper include the use of a small dataset and the lack of quantitative evaluation. The authors also use a simple intuition to propose the DELTA technique, and it is not entirely clear how the technique helps preserve the semantics of the target network.

Turn 6:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I am leaning towards accepting the paper, but I have some concerns about the limitations. Can you tell me more about the confidence of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Based on the reviews, Reviewer 1 has a confidence rating of 7, Reviewer 2 has a confidence rating of 6, and Reviewer 3 has a confidence rating of 4. The reviewers have some concerns about the limitations of the paper, but they generally agree that the technique is interesting and valuable.

Turn 7:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and the limitations of the paper, I have decided to accept the paper with conditions. I would like to see more thorough evaluation and a larger dataset in future work.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your decision. I will communicate the decision to the authors.
