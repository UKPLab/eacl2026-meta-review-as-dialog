DM: Hello, can you tell me more about the financial crisis and who is to blame for it?

DA: Certainly. The topic of the debate is "Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis." On the "for" side, they argue that while bankers were greedy and incompetent, politicians hold more responsibility for the crisis. They claim that politicians try to divert attention from their own responsibility by blaming Wall Street. On the "against" side, they argue that the crisis was caused by systemic issues involving residential home finance, and that blaming politicians instead of Wall Street is misplaced.

DM: Can you provide more information on the arguments made by the "for" side? 

DA: The "for" side argues that it's easy to blame everything on the bankers, but in reality, politicians should be held more responsible. They highlight individuals like Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers, who was paid $72 million in 2007 before his firm collapsed, and James Cayne of Bear Stearns, who made $290 million in the nine years before his firm vanished without trace. They argue that while Wall Street has plenty of blame to take, it is not unitary and encompasses individuals who are only operating in their own self-interest. They claim that politicians always wax indignant about finance at times like these to divert attention from Washington's own responsibility for the debacle.

DM: What arguments are made by the "against" side?

DA: The "against" side argues that blaming politicians instead of Wall Street for the crisis is misplaced. They claim that systemic issues involving residential home finance are at the heart of the problem and highlight the collapse of Lehman and Bear, which were not as involved in residential mortgage finance as other institutions. They believe that blaming Wall Street is appropriate since it's a metonym for the American financial market, which operates around the globe and is deeply entrenched in the socioeconomic spectrum.
