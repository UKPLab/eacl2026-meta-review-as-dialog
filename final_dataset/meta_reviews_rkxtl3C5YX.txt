Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Understanding & Generalizing AlphaGo Zero," and I have some questions regarding the paper's acceptance.

Dialogue Agent: Hello, Meta-Reviewer. I'm here to answer your questions to the best of my ability.

Meta-Reviewer: Great. So, Reviewer 1 seems to have some concerns about the paper's claims regarding the KL-divergence bound and the MCTS policy not being the same as the optimal policy. What is your take on these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: As the dialogue agent, I cannot provide my own opinion or recommendation. However, I can confirm the reviewer's concerns are valid and reflect the limitations of the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: I understand. Moving onto Reviewer 2, they seem more positive about the paper but have some criticisms, such as the relevance of the robust MDP formalization and neglecting the error term corresponding to the value function. Can you provide any insights into these criticisms?

Dialogue Agent: Once again, I cannot offer any personal insights or opinions. However, I can say that the reviewer's criticisms are valid and something the authors should consider in their future work.

Meta-Reviewer: Alright. Finally, Reviewer 3 seems to have some reservations about the paper's theoretical results and experimental sections. What is your perspective on their concerns?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer's concerns appear to be grounded in a thorough reading of the paper and deserve attention. It is necessary for the authors to address these concerns before deciding on acceptance.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your answers, Dialogue Agent. Considering all the reviews, do you have any confidence in recommending this paper's acceptance?
