Decision Maker: Hi, I'm interested in learning more about the Buy American/Hire American policies and whether they will backfire. Can you provide me with some information on this topic?

Dialogue Agent: Absolutely. To begin with, the Buy American provision in federal legislation mandates the purchase of U.S. made products in government contracts. While the idea of buying American products and supporting the American economy may seem like a good idea, the means to achieving that laudable end is the point of debate here tonight. The opposing side argues that Buy American policies will create jobs in the steel industry and in the steel using sectors. However, evidence suggests that these policies have already backfired and are counterproductive.

Decision Maker: Can you elaborate on how the Buy American policies have backfired?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. For instance, the Bay Bridge in China is almost eight months behind schedule because the steel from China failed to hold the weld. This represents a significant loss in terms of dollars and productivity. Moreover, the government spends three trillion tax dollars per year in federal procurement, which means that simply using tax dollars to buy Chinese goods is not a solution.

Decision Maker: What are the arguments against the Buy American policies?

Dialogue Agent: The opposing side argues that the broader issue here is about tariffs versus free trade, protectionism versus free trade. They also argue that Smoot-Hawley, a canard acknowledged by mainstream economists as having little effect on exacerbating the Great Depression, should not be used as a reference point. It is important to understand that both sides have valid points, and it ultimately depends on how you interpret the evidence presented.
