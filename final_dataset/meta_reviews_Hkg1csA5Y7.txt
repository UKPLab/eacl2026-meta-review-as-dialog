Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for submitting this paper. I have carefully read the paper and the reviews. Can you summarize the main contributions of your paper?

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for considering our paper. The main contribution of our paper is a fast quasi-Newton-type method for large-scale stochastic optimization that incorporates second-order information in a novel way. We propose a simpler Hessian inverse approximation and a new stochastic linesearch method, which is different from existing approaches such as LBFGS or BFGS. Our method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and LBFGS on various benchmark datasets.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Can you address the concerns raised by the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. Reviewer 1 raised concerns about the justification of our method and some missing details in the experiment section. We agree that we can provide more details about parameter settings and computation costs, and we will include the missing details in the revised version. As for the justification, we believe that our method is novel and competitive with existing methods, as shown in our experiments. We will also provide more theoretical justification in the revised version.

Reviewer 2 raised concerns about the Hessian inverse approximation and the stochastic linesearch algorithm. We agree that the approach we propose relaxes the symmetry and secant conditions that are typically enforced in quasi-Newton methods. However, we believe that this approach can still lead to a better algorithm, particularly in noisy or stochastic settings where the true Hessian is not accessible. As for the regularization parameter lambda, we will investigate how it affects the quality of the Hessian approximation and provide more details in the revised version. We also agree that the proof for the stochastic linesearch needs more rigorous reasoning and more detail about the practical implementation. We will provide a more detailed explanation and address the reviewers' questions in the revised version.

Reviewer 3 raised concerns about the lack of convincing explanations supporting our ideas and the need for more empirical evidence. We agree that we need to provide more details about algorithmic choices, parameter settings, and computation costs in the experiments section. As for the lack of convincing explanations, we will provide more theoretical justification in the revised version. We also agree that we need more experimental and theoretical work to support our claims, and we will address these concerns in the revised version.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews and your responses, I think that your paper has potential, but there are still some concerns that need to be addressed. I would recommend a major revision of the paper that addresses the reviewers' concerns. If you can provide more theoretical justification and empirical evidence, as well as more details about parameter settings and computation costs, I think that your paper could be accepted for publication.
