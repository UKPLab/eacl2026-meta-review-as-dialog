Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have reviewed the three reviews for "PATE-GAN: Generating Synthetic Data with Differential Privacy Guarantees" and I have a few questions for you. 

Dialogue agent: Sure, I'm here to answer any questions you may have. 

Meta-reviewer: Can you explain the key novelty of this paper? 

Dialogue agent: The key novelty of this paper is the integration of the PATE differential privacy framework into a GAN to generate synthetic data in a differentially private manner. Instead of a single distinguisher as is usual in a GAN, there is a "student distinguisher" and several "teacher distinguishers". The student distinguisher is used as usual, except that it does not have access to the real data, only the teacher distinguishers have access to the real data (as well as the synthetic data). The data is partitioned amongst the teacher distinguishers and their output is aggregated in a differentially private manner (and gradients are not revealed). The role of the teacher distinguishers is solely to correct the student distinguisher when it errs. 

Meta-reviewer: What do you think of Review 1's comment about the generator's only feedback being from the gradients of the student distinguisher, which is never exposed to the real data?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation, but I can let you know that the paper remarks about this in the middle of page 5 and acknowledges that it may be surprising that this works, but experimental results back it up. 

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 suggested some areas of improvement for the paper. Has the paper addressed these concerns in their revision?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I do not have access to the revised paper, but I can inform you that Review 2 mentioned that the authors' comments addressed their concerns, especially on the experiment side, and changed their score to marginally above the acceptance threshold. 

Meta-reviewer: What do you think about Review 3's question regarding the extension of uniformly random samples to high-dimensional settings?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation, but I can inform you that Review 3 found the idea of bypassing the use of public data by taking uniformly random samples interesting and wonders if this result extends to high-dimensional settings (i.e., where d is very large). 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your informative answers. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to accept this paper. However, I am concerned about Review 2's evaluation being marginally above the acceptance threshold. Can you provide any additional information regarding the importance of the contributions of this paper and the confidence level of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I can inform you that the paper's contribution of generating synthetic data with differential privacy guarantees is an important and long-standing problem. Reviewers 1 and 3 rated the paper as a good paper and found it interesting and novel, while Review 2 rated it marginally above the acceptance threshold but still found it to be a good paper with some areas of improvement. The confidence levels of all three reviewers were at least 3 out of 5, indicating some level of confidence in their evaluations. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. That's helpful. Based on the reviews and your responses, I have decided to accept this paper.
