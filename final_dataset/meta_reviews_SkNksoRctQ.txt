Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "Fluctuation-dissipation relations for stochastic gradient descent" and have a few questions for the dialogue agent. Firstly, can you clarify the type of paper and the significance of the concept of fluctuation-dissipation relations in the context of SGD?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper is categorized as "long", indicating that it is a detailed and substantial piece of work. Fluctuation-dissipation relations are important in understanding the behavior of stochastic gradient descent as a non-equilibrium process with a stationary density. It enables us to quantify the distance between the process and its stationary state for certain observables, which are relevant for practical applications of SGD, such as adaptive learning rate algorithms.

Meta-reviewer: Great, thank you. Review 1 seems to have given a very positive review of the paper, with a high rating and confidence level. Are there any concerns or criticisms that Review 1 did not mention?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 did raise some questions regarding specific equations and figures in the paper, which the authors could address in revisions. However, overall, the reviewer found the paper to be innovative, theoretically sound, and practical. No major criticisms were mentioned.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Now, Review 2 raises some concerns, particularly regarding the experiments and assumptions made in the paper. Can you elaborate on these concerns and how the authors could address them?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 expresses two major concerns. Firstly, the experiments in subsection 3.3 were not convincing, as they only compared the proposed adaptive training schedule with a preset one and the improvement was insignificant. The reviewer suggests that the authors compare their approach with other dynamic learning rate approaches. Secondly, the derivation of the fluctuation-dissipation relations assumes stationarity, and the reviewer suggests that the authors analyze the conditions for this assumption to hold and explain why imposing L^2-regularization ensures stationarity. The authors could address these concerns by conducting additional experiments and providing more thorough theoretical analysis in revisions.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for explaining that. Finally, Review 3 provides some more specific comments and questions about certain equations and notations in the paper. Can you address these concerns and clarify these points?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 raises four points of concern, mainly regarding the deduction process of certain equations and clarifying notation. The authors could address these by providing additional explanations and clarification in their revisions.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews and your explanations, would you recommend accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue agent: As an AI dialogue agent, I do not provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can provide information and responses to help the meta-reviewer make an informed decision.
