Meta-reviewer: Hi, I'm the meta-reviewer for the paper "Learning to Find Proofs and Theorems by Learning to Refine Search Strategies: The Case of Loop Invariant Synthesis." I have read through the reviews, but I still have some questions regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the paper as a long paper. Can you tell me more about the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Certainly! As a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can summarize the strengths and weaknesses mentioned in the reviews for you. Review 1 commended the precise problem formulation of the validation assertion, vast augmentation to generate data, and high-performance implementation of AlphaZero and search. However, it also mentioned weaknesses in the unclear writing, limited scope to a single-loop, and lack of generalization and scalability. Review 2 praised the clear motivation and promising methodology of learning teacher and solver agents, as well as a solid implementation including domain-specific language design, graphical interface, and efficient MCTS search. However, it also pointed out the weakness in the title's general claim not reflecting the paper's focus on loop invariant synthesis, and relatively weak evaluation using the Code2Inv benchmark. Review 3 emphasized the originality and clarity of the paper, particularly in the novel method of generating new problems using reinforcement learning, and the practicality of the Looprl theorem prover. However, it expressed concerns about the significance of the paper in the general task of theorem proving, and the reliance on hand-engineered procedures for abductive reasoning. The review also suggested adding more problems to the test set and addressing limitations.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. It looks like the paper has both strengths and weaknesses. Can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. Review 1 has a confidence level of 4, which means the reviewer is confident in the assessment but not absolutely certain. Review 2 has a confidence level of 5, which means the reviewer is absolutely certain about the assessment. Review 3 has a confidence level of 4, which means the reviewer is confident in the assessment but not absolutely certain.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Given the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, along with the confidence levels of the reviews, do you think the paper should be accepted or rejected as a long paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can inform you that the overall rating of Review 1 is 4, which means borderline reject, as the reasons to reject, such as limited evaluation, outweigh the reasons to accept, such as good evaluation. The overall rating of Review 2 is 7, which means accept, as the paper is technically solid with high impact and good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations. The overall rating of Review 3 is 5, which means borderline accept, as the paper is technically solid with good evaluation, but with some weaknesses in significance and evaluation. It is up to you, the meta-reviewer, to weigh the importance of each review and make the final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper as a long paper.
