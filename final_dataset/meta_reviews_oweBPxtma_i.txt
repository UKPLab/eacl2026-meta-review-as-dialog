Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the Meta-Reviewer, tasked with making a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper titled "A self-explanatory method for the black box problem on discrimination part of CNN." Can you provide me with some information on the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, Meta-Reviewer. There are three reviews. Review 1 rates the paper slightly below the acceptance threshold, with a confidence of 3. Review 2 rates the paper as clear rejection, but the reviewer might not have understood some central parts of the paper. The confidence for this review is 2. Review 3 also rates the paper as a clear rejection, with a higher confidence of 4.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you tell me about the type of the paper and the reviews' major concerns?

Dialogue Agent: The type of the paper is long, and the major concerns from Review 1 include the lack of clear notation and definitions, an unclear iterative optimization procedure, a large accuracy gap for more challenging datasets, and numerous typos. Review 2 mentions numerous syntactic and grammatical errors and criticizes the focus on fully connected layers instead of more realistic datasets or logistic regression. Review 3 highlights issues with readability and technical errors in the method, such as ignoring the partition functions in some equations.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Can you tell me about the confidence levels of each review?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 1 has a confidence of 3, Review 2 has a confidence of 2, and Review 3 has a higher confidence level of 4.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Given these reviews, what is your recommendation for the acceptance or rejection of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide you with recommendations or opinions. However, I can tell you that two reviews rate the paper as a clear rejection, while one review rates it slightly below the acceptance threshold. The concerns raised by the reviews revolve around readability, technical errors, and a lack of clear explanations, which might warrant a rejection.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Given review 1's relatively low confidence, I would like to know if the concerns raised in that review are significant enough to tip the decision towards rejection?

Dialogue Agent: Again, as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or influence the decision. However, Review 1 raises several significant concerns, such as unclear notation and definitions, an unclear iterative optimization procedure, and large accuracy gaps for more challenging datasets. These concerns could be enough to tip the decision towards rejection, especially if they are not addressed in a revision.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Thank you for your help. I will take into account the confidence levels and concerns raised by the reviews before making my decision.
