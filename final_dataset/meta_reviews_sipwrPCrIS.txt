Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I've read the reviews for the paper "Self-Consistent Dynamical Field Theory of Kernel Evolution in Wide Neural Networks." Can you provide me with more details about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. The paper proposes a self-consistent dynamical field theory to analyze feature learning in infinite-width neural networks trained with gradient descent. The authors show that the order parameters can be characterized by inner-product kernels and solve the self-consistent equations analytically for linear networks or numerically for nonlinear networks.

Meta-reviewer: What types of strengths are mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 mentions that understanding feature learning is a crucial open theoretical problem for neural networks and the work makes a strong original contribution with interesting results. Review 2 highlights the novelty of the idea to use dynamical field theory to simulate the dynamics of infinitely wide neural networks, and the good agreement between theory predictions and simulations.

Meta-reviewer: And what about weaknesses?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 notes that most of the calculations are relegated to the supplement, and it's not entirely clear what is proved rigorously. It also mentions that there is little interpretation of the features learned in the limit. Review 2 points out that the self-consistent equations are not very interpretable, and the computational cost for solving them is very expensive.

Meta-reviewer: The rating for the paper is "strong accept" from Review 1 and "accept" from Review 2 and 3. Which review should carry more weight?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that Review 1 gave the highest rating and was more positive about the paper than the other two reviews.

Meta-reviewer: How confident are the reviewers in their assessments?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 had a confidence score of 4, which means they were confident in their assessment but not absolutely certain. Review 2 and 3 both had a confidence score of 3, which means they were fairly confident in their assessments, but it's possible they didn't understand some parts of the submission or were unfamiliar with related work.
