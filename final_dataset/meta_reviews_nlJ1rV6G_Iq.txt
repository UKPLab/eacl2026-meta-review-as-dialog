 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "CSAW-M: An Ordinal Classification Dataset for Benchmarking Mammographic Masking of Cancer":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "CSAW-M: An Ordinal Classification Dataset for Benchmarking Mammographic Masking of Cancer". Can you tell me a bit about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper presents a new mammographic dataset called CSAW-M, which is a subset of the larger CSAW dataset. CSAW-M contains data from 10,020 patients aged between 40 and 74, with masks manually outlined by 5 specialists. The dataset is divided into three subsets: public train, public test, and private test. The authors also trained two generic ResNet models and report results within the inter-expert variability.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds like a very large and well-annotated dataset. What are the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper's main contributions are the proposed dataset, the inter-expert variability intervals, and the well-balanced data. Additionally, the dataset is the largest of its kind and has the potential to have a bold impact on the community.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the dataset's limitations?

Dialogue Agent: The dataset is not open to all organizations, as it can only be used by non-profit organizations. Additionally, the online system the authors claim to have is not accessible to all users, as it is hosted on a Swedish hosting system that only Swedish University members can access.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: I understand. How does the paper address the issue of masking potential in mammographic images?

Dialogue Agent: The paper addresses the issue of masking potential in mammographic images by providing a new dataset with manually outlined masks. The dataset is divided into three subsets, and the authors trained two generic ResNet models to evaluate the inter-expert variability.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. What are the reviewers' opinions on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers have mixed opinions on the paper. Reviewer 1 finds the dataset to be very large and well-annotated, with a well-balanced data set. Reviewer 2 appreciates the dataset's potential to establish new lines of research and establish new lines of research. However, Reviewer 3 has some concerns about the dataset's limitations and the online system's accessibility.

Turn 6:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the reviews, I think the paper has some strengths, but also some limitations. I will consider the paper's contributions, limitations, and the reviewers' opinions when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I hope this information helps you make your decision. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
