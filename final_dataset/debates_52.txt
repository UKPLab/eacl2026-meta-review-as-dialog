Decision maker: Hi there, I'm trying to decide whether courts or campuses should decide sexual assault cases. What do you think?

Dialogue agent: As a neutral party, I cannot provide my own opinions. However, I can provide arguments for both sides. Would you like to hear them?

Decision maker: Yes, please.

Dialogue agent: On one hand, those who argue that courts should decide sexual assault cases may point to the fact that universities and colleges have faced criticism for not taking sexual assault seriously enough. They may also argue that sexual assault is a criminal violation and should be tried in a professional court setting.

Decision maker: Hmm, I see. And what about arguments for the other side?

Dialogue agent: Those who argue that campuses should decide sexual assault cases may point out that campus officials generally have more experience and training in dealing with sexual assault cases. Additionally, victims may feel more comfortable reporting their assaults to universities and colleges, rather than going through the criminal justice system.

Decision maker: Interesting. So, what are some specific arguments for each side?

Dialogue agent: For those in favor of courts deciding sexual assault cases, Jeannie Suk, a professor of law at Harvard University, has argued that sexual assault accusations should be treated like any other serious criminal matter and should be handled by judges and trained lawyers. 

On the other hand, Stephen Schulhofer, a law professor at the New York University School of Law, has argued that universities and colleges need to be more involved in addressing sexual assault cases because the legal system can be complex and intimidating for victims.

Decision maker: I see. This is a tough decision. Can you provide any other insights that might help me decide which side has a stronger argument?

Dialogue agent: Ultimately, this is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. It may be helpful for you to consider the specific context of your decision and weigh the pros and cons of each option. For instance, are you trying to decide what to do in response to a specific case on a particular campus, or are you thinking more broadly about policies at the national level?

Decision maker: That's a great point. I will definitely take that into consideration. Thank you for your help.

Dialogue agent: You're welcome. Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any other questions.
