Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews and I have some questions about the paper "Defuse: Debugging Classifiers Through Distilling Unrestricted Adversarial Examples." My first question is about the clustering approach used in the paper. Reviewer 1 mentioned that it is not clear why the Dirichlet process is the best fit for the clustering approach. Can you explain why this method was chosen over other clustering approaches?

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your question. As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but I can provide information from the paper. In our paper, we choose the Dirichlet process because it is a non-parametric clustering approach that can handle a varying number of clusters. This is important for our approach, as the number of failure scenarios can vary depending on the specific dataset. Additionally, it allows us to use Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of the model, which can improve the accuracy of the clustering.

Meta-Reviewer: I see, thank you for the explanation. My next question is about the user annotation process. Reviewer 2 mentioned that it is important to have well-defined procedures in terms of determining the appropriate number of annotators and resolving disagreements between them. Can you provide more information about the annotation process used in the paper, such as inter-annotator agreement?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, in our paper, we used five workers to label the instances, and the final label was determined by majority vote. We did not provide information about inter-annotator agreement, but we made sure that all workers had experience in data annotation and received clear instructions for the task. We also provided examples and held training sessions to ensure the quality of the annotations.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. My last question is about the contribution of the paper. Reviewer 3 mentioned that it is not clear whether the proposed method is for debugging classifiers or for defense against on-manifold adversarial attacks. Can you provide more information about the objective of the paper and how it differs from similar techniques?

Dialogue Agent: Our paper proposes a method to identify and correct regions on the data manifold in which a trained classifier fails. The identification phase is based on clustering classification failure regions in a GAN latent space, and the correction phase is based on fine-tuning the classifier with additional synthetic samples from the GAN. Our approach differs from similar techniques in that it involves clustering the adversarial examples and using them to fine-tune the classifier, which can improve its overall performance. However, as Reviewer 3 pointed out, the objective of our proposed method may not be clear, and there may be some overlap with defense against on-manifold adversarial attacks. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews, I have some concerns about the clarity and significance of the contributions. However, Reviewer 2 has rated the paper above the acceptance threshold. Can you provide any additional information that may help me make a decision about whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but I can provide additional information from the paper. In Appendix A, we include detailed experimental results, such as accuracy values on the train, test, and adversarial sets before and after the fine-tuning, which can help demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we have addressed some of the concerns raised by the reviewers in our response to their comments, which may help clarify the contributions of our paper.
