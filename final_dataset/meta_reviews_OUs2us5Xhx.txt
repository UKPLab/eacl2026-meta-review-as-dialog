 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "MAEA: Multimodal Attribution for Embodied AI":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "MAEA: Multimodal Attribution for Embodied AI". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a multimodal attribution method for embodied AI, which allows for interpreting the decision-making process of end-to-end policies. It also explores different modal attribution importance and how it relates to the policy's performance.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the reviewers' opinions on this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Reviewer 1 found the paper to be novel and well-written, with interesting insights into multi-modal frameworks for embodied AI. Reviewer 2 appreciated the motivation of the paper and the inclusion of different pooling approaches, but had some concerns about the lack of agreement on the goals and evaluation mechanisms of feature attribution methods. Reviewer 3 recommended spending more time building up the motivation for why multi-modal attribution is important and adding more justification behind the choice of the 4 models analyzed.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Thanks for summarizing the reviews. How do you think the paper's contributions and findings relate to the state of the art in this field?

Dialogue Agent: The paper contributes to the growing body of literature on feature attribution methods for multimodal inputs. It provides a new approach to interpreting the decision-making process of end-to-end policies and offers insights into the importance of different modal attribution. The paper also compares the performance of different pooling approaches and their implications for attribution.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. Based on the reviews and your summary, I'm leaning towards accepting the paper. However, I want to consider the reviewer confidence and the potential impact of the paper. Can you provide any additional information to help me make my decision?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers' confidence in the evaluation is moderate to high, with Reviewer 1 expressing the highest confidence. The paper's findings have the potential to improve our understanding of multi-modal attribution and its role in end-to-end policies. Additionally, the paper's proposed approach could be useful in real-world applications where post-hoc interpretability is important.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews and your summary, I have decided to accept the paper with a confidence level of 7.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I'm glad I could assist you in making your decision.
