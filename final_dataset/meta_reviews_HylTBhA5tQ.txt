Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "The Limitations of Adversarial Training and the Blind-Spot Attack" and I have a few questions before making a final decision on accepting or rejecting it. 

Dialogue agent: Sure, I will do my best to assist you. 

Meta-reviewer: The first review seems generally positive, but the reviewer mentions a lack of theoretical analysis. Can you explain if the paper adequately addresses this concern? 

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I can't provide opinions or recommendations, but I can tell you that the paper focuses on demonstrating the influence of data distribution on the effectiveness of adversarial training and how the distance between training and test datasets plays an important role. It proposes a metric to measure this distance and provides empirical evidence to support its claims. 

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Review 2 raises concerns about the complexity and computational expense of the proposed methodology. Can you comment on this? 

Dialogue agent: The paper presents a methodology to measure the distance between training and test datasets using a combination of nonlinear projection, kernel density estimation, and K-L divergence. While the reviewer raises concerns about the complexity and computational expense of this methodology, it is important to note that simpler metrics such as histograms are not informative enough to detect blind-spot transformations. The paper also provides evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. 

Meta-reviewer: Lastly, review 3 raises several concerns, including the lack of empirical comparison between blind-spot attacks and prior work, the possibility of defending against blind-spot attacks, and the metric used for the success of blind-spot attacks. Can you address these concerns? 

Dialogue agent: The paper claims that the proposed blind-spot attack is effective in defeating robust adversarial training, and it demonstrates this claim through empirical evidence on the MNIST dataset. While the reviewer asks for empirical comparisons with prior work, the paper argues that the proposed blind-spot attack is simpler than complex generative models and is effective in detecting blind-spots. 

Regarding the possibility of defending against blind-spot attacks, the paper proposes a linear transformation for the blind-spot attack, and while the reviewer suggests modifying the inner maximization to defend against these attacks, the paper does not address this suggestion. 

Finally, the paper uses a stricter criterion for the success of blind-spot attacks, as it scales the image by a factor of alpha, and requires that perturbations be less than alpha epsilon to be counted as a successful attack. While the reviewer questions this metric, the paper justifies it based on the scaling factor in the blind-spot attack. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses, Dialogue Agent. Based on the reviews, I think I can accept this paper, but I would like to know your confidence level in the paper's acceptance. 

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews provided, it appears that the paper meets the acceptance threshold, and the reviewers are generally positive. The first review suggests acceptance, the second review suggests acceptance but raises some concerns, and the third review suggests that the paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold. Overall, the reviewers' confidence levels are moderate to high. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help, Dialogue Agent. Based on the reviews and your input, I will accept this paper. 

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, Meta-reviewer. I'm glad I could be of assistance.
