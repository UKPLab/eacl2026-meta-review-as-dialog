Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have reviewed the three reviews provided for the paper "Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Data with a Selection Bias." Can you provide me with more information about the paper and address some of my concerns and questions?

Dialogue Agent: Of course, Meta-reviewer. The paper proposes a new technique for learning from positive and unlabeled data that addresses the issue of selection bias, which occurs when the observed positive instances are not necessarily drawn from the true positive distribution. The authors propose a scoring function that preserves the order of the label posteriors and can be learned without making assumptions about the exact posterior of p(y|...). The paper includes two algorithms for ranking instances based on their probability of being labeled, and the approach is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Review 1 seems to have a positive evaluation of the paper, while Review 2 has some concerns and questions about the novelty and limitations of the proposed approach. Review 3 also has concerns about the experiments and the lack of comparison with previous work. How do you address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: As the paper type is "long," the authors have the space to provide more details and clarifications in response to the reviewers' concerns. Regarding Review 2, the authors can address the potential limitations of the proposed approach and explain why they chose the specific loss functions and scoring function restrictions. They can also provide more discussion on the connection between their work and previous works in the field. For Review 3, the authors can provide more experiments using estimates of the positive class prior instead of assuming it is known, and compare their approach to other related works. The authors can also add more discussion on related work and the motivation behind their assumption of Invariance of Order.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What do you think about the confidence levels of the reviewers' evaluations?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 has a confidence level of 2, indicating that the reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation but may not have understood central parts of the paper. Review 2 has a confidence level of 4, indicating that the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. Review 3 also has a confidence level of 4, indicating a similar level of confidence. It is up to the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in making the final decision.

Meta-reviewer: I appreciate your responses, Dialogue Agent. Based on what you shared, I will need more information and clarification from the authors before making a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.
