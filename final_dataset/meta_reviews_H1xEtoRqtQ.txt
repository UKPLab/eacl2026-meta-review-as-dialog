 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Scaling Shared Model Governance via Model Splitting":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi there, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Scaling Shared Model Governance via Model Splitting". Can you provide a summary of the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper "Scaling Shared Model Governance via Model Splitting" proposes a novel approach to scaling shared model governance via model splitting. The authors argue that traditional approaches to shared model governance, such as homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation, are not fully satisfactory in the domain of neural network learning. Instead, they propose a new measure of hardness-of-model-completion, MC-hardness_T(\alpha), which quantifies the difficulty of completing a trained neural network using a subset of its layers. The authors provide extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed measure.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. However, I have some concerns about the positioning and execution of the paper. Specifically, I think the authors spend too much time arguing against cryptographically-motivated techniques, which are not the main focus of the paper. Additionally, I am not convinced that the proposed measure of hardness-of-model-completion is the right one to use. Can you address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, I can address those concerns. The authors do spend some time discussing the limitations of traditional approaches to shared model governance, but they argue that these approaches are not directly applicable to the domain of neural network learning. Instead, they propose a new measure of hardness-of-model-completion, MC-hardness_T(\alpha), which takes into account the complexity of the neural network architecture and the amount of training data available. The authors provide extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed measure.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: I see. But I still have some concerns about the empirical results. Specifically, I am not convinced that the proposed measure of hardness-of-model-completion is the right one to use. Additionally, I think the authors should have provided more information about the similarity metric used in Section 3.1. Can you address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, I can address those concerns. The authors use a similarity metric to compare the performance of different approaches to completing a trained neural network. The similarity metric is defined as the ratio of the accuracy of the completed model to the accuracy of the original model. The authors provide extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed measure. Additionally, the authors note that the similarity metric is not the only possible measure of completion hardness, and they suggest that other measures could also be used.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for addressing my concerns. Based on the information you provided, I would rate this paper as "marginally below acceptance threshold" with a confidence of "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct". Can you provide any additional information or insights that might change my mind?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, I can provide additional information that might change your mind. The authors note that their proposed measure of hardness-of-model-completion is not the only possible measure, and they suggest that other measures could also be used. Additionally, the authors provide extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed measure, and they note that their approach can be applied to a wide range of neural network architectures and training datasets. These factors could potentially make the paper more compelling and increase its rating.
