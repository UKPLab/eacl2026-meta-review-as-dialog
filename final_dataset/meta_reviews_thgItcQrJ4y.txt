Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have read the reviews of the paper "Analyzing Sharpness along GD Trajectory: Progressive Sharpening and Edge of Stability." Can you give me some insights into the paper before I make a decision on whether to accept or reject it?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I'd be happy to. This paper provides a theoretical explanation for the phenomena of progressive sharpening and edge of stability observed in Cohen et al. (2021). The paper divides the analysis into four stages and studies the behavior of the leading eigenvalue. It also proves the theorems in the setting of two-layer linear neural networks and verifies some assumptions with numerical experiments.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 recommends accepting the paper, while Review 2 suggests rejecting it due to the heuristic nature of the derivations. However, Review 3 recommends strong acceptance, indicating the paper presents novel ideas. As the meta-reviewer, I am concerned about reviewer confidence. What can you tell me about the confidence levels of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer confidence in each case is moderate, with emphasis on how the paper contributes to research in this area. Review 1 expresses confidence in the technical soundness of the paper. Review 2, however, disagrees with some of the assumptions in the paper and finds its claims unconvincing, while Review 3 praises the rigour of the analysis of the two-layer linear network.

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me more about the weaknesses pointed out in each review? And do you think the weaknesses negate the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 raises a concern about how to handle several eigenvalues close to $2/\eta$, which is observed by Cohen et al. but ruled out by some of the paper's assumptions. Review 2 is at its weakest when it attempts to argue that its EoS analysis for two-layer linear networks could not carry over in a very literal manner to more general neural networks, while Review 3 points out that the paper's claims about the progressive sharpening and edge of stability phenomena do not necessarily apply to all neural networks. Overall, while there are some weaknesses, the strengths of the paper, such as the rigor of the two-layer linear network analysis and the novelty of the explanation for progressive sharpening, seem to outweigh these weaknesses.

Meta-reviewer: Based on what you have told me, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. However, I would like to confirm the credibility of the reviews with the authors. Can you arrange for a discussion between them and me?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. I will set up a meeting between you and the authors to clarify any questions or concerns you may have.
