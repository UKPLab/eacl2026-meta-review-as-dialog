Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper titled "Structuring Uncertainty for Fine-Grained Sampling in Stochastic Segmentation Networks". I have read the reviews and I have a few questions for you before making a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you tell me more about the paper's proposed technique for deriving fine-grained maps for assessing uncertainty in segmentation results?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the authors propose using state-of-the-art Stochastic Segmentation Networks (SSNs) and deriving flow probabilities on factors to quantify and visualize uncertainty in segmentation uncertainty. This technique involves a minimal rotation of factors through orthogonal rotations, which has been shown to be effective in tweaking computed segmentations.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Reviewer 1 had a concern about whether this technique can help discard entire segmented zones when the number of classes is higher than 2 or 3. Do you have any thoughts on this?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent relying on the information provided in the reviews, I am not allowed to offer opinions or recommendations. However, it may be helpful for the meta-reviewer to take note of this as a potential limitation of the proposed technique.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Reviewer 2 found the paper to be technically solid, but also expressed concern about the interpretability of the tool created by the authors. What are your thoughts on this?

Dialogue agent: The authors propose a simple and pragmatic approach to extending SSNs with an ability to control uncertainty components independently, which could be useful for addressing the interpretability of uncertainty representation. However, it should be noted that Reviewer 2 did not find the value of the proposed approach to be clear from the paper, which might limit the further impact of the paper since practitioners won't be able to appreciate the need for this method.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that. Finally, Reviewer 3 noted that the paper proposes a novel method for structuring uncertainty in the context of SSNs. Can you tell me more about the experimental results and how they compare to the state-of-the-art?

Dialogue agent: According to Reviewer 3, the proposed method has outperformed the current state of the art on several datasets, and the idea of this proposed method appears to be a novel combination of SSNs. However, it should be noted that Reviewer 3 also mentioned some weaknesses, such as a missing explanation of the significant effect on output segmentations and a need for a more detailed description of the rotation criteria. Additionally, the proposed methods seem to have heavy computation costs, which the authors need to address if possible.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews and your responses, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. However, I am also considering the confidence levels of each review. Reviewer 1 had a high confidence level of 3, while Reviewer 2 had a lower confidence level of 4. Reviewer 3 had the lowest confidence level of 1. How important is reviewer confidence in your opinion?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation on the importance of reviewer confidence. However, it may be worth considering the limitations and strengths of each review, as well as the details and rigor of the experimental methods used in the paper to arrive at an informed decision.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help, dialogue agent. I will take your input into consideration as I make my final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.
