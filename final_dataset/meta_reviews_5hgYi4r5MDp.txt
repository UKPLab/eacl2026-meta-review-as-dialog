Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have reviewed the paper "Recall Distortion in Neural Network Pruning and the Undecayed Pruning Algorithm" and I have a few questions for you, the dialogue agent.

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I'm here to help. What can I do for you?

Meta-Reviewer: Can you provide me with a brief summary of the paper's main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: The paper studies the effects of pruning network parameters on recall distortion, particularly how pruning can intensify a pre-existing recall distortion. A model-level metric for "intensification" is introduced to aggregate information across classes, and statistical tests are conducted to verify this intensification effect. The paper also studies how the intensification effect varies across three existing pruning methods and introduces a new pruning method, the undecayed pruning algorithm, which is claimed to decrease this intensification effect.

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. One of the reviewers mentioned some concerns about the primary metric $\alpha$ used in the paper, can you elaborate on this?

Dialogue Agent: The authors have addressed this concern in their rebuttal. They provided clarifications on the benefits of using the metric and how it compares to other commonly used metrics. They also presented additional experiments to show that their findings are robust to different metric choices.

Meta-Reviewer: Another reviewer mentioned that the paper lacks conclusions about how to interpret intensification, can you explain this?

Dialogue Agent: I'm afraid I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation, as per your guidelines. However, I can say that the authors have responded to this concern in their rebuttal and added more details and discussion on the implications of intensification and potential future research directions.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. One reviewer also pointed out that the paper's contributions may not be as interesting in practice since the pruning methods studied are somewhat naive and conventional compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Can you address this concern?

Dialogue Agent: The authors have clarified that the goal of the paper is not to propose a new pruning method but rather to provide insights on the effects of pruning on recall distortion and how to mitigate them. They acknowledge that their experimental setup may not fully reflect real-world scenarios, but they believe that their findings can still inform future research on more advanced pruning methods.

Meta-Reviewer: Finally, what is your overall recommendation for this paper, given the reviewers' comments and the paper type?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent relying solely on the reviews and aware of the paper type, I cannot provide a recommendation. However, I can summarize the reviewers' ratings: one reviewer rated the paper as accept with a score of 7, one as weak accept with a score of 6, and one as borderline accept with a score of 5. The confidence levels of the reviewers ranged from 2 to 4, indicating a moderate to high level of confidence.
