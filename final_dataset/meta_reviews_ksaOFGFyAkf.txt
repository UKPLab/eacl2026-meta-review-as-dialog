Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Effects of Visual Distinctiveness on Learning and Retrieval in Icon Toolbars". I see that the paper has received three reviews and all of them recommend accepting the paper. However, I have some questions for you about the paper and the reviews before making a final decision.

Dialogue Agent: Hello, I'm here to answer your questions. Please go ahead.

Meta-Reviewer: First of all, can you tell me what the paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The paper investigates how the visual distinctiveness of icons in toolbars impacts the speed with which users can learn and subsequently retrieve the locations of icons. The results suggest that color and shape distinctiveness in themselves are not very helpful with learning and retrieval of icons, particularly compared to icons expressing a meaning congruent with their associated commands.

Meta-Reviewer: And what is the type of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper is classified as long.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay. Let me ask you some questions based on the reviews. Review 1 asks about the lack of clear contributions and suggests reviewing a related paper. Can you address that?

Dialogue Agent: While I cannot provide an opinion on the quality of the paper, I can confirm that the paper does discuss the contributions of the research. Specifically, the authors argue that their work provides empirical evidence that adding visual distinctiveness to toolbar icons may not lead to better performance, contrary to some prior beliefs. Additionally, the authors discuss the implications of their findings for interface design. As for the related paper suggested in the review, the authors do mention and compare their work with Bateman et al. (2010), which is a relevant study on the impact of visual embellishment on comprehension and memorability of charts.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 1 also asks about the participants' age groups and technical expertise. Is that information provided in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper provides information about the participants' age and technical backgrounds in both studies. In Study 1, the participants were university students recruited through a participant pool, and in Study 2, the participants were recruited via Mechanical Turk.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 1 also asks whether the two studies involved the same set of participants. Can you answer that?

Dialogue Agent: No, the two studies did not involve the same set of participants. They used different sets of participants recruited through different methods.

Meta-Reviewer: Let's move to Review 2. This reviewer asks about the task's realism and density of icons in all together on the screen. Can you provide some insights?

Dialogue Agent: The authors acknowledge the potential limitations of the study design, including the fact that the task may not directly reflect the real-world tasks of using icons in software and the density of icons presented on the screen. However, they argue that the task is a good way to isolate the effect of distinctiveness on learning and retrieval. As for the density of icons, the authors point out that the number of icons was within the range of the typical number of toolbar icons found in software interfaces.

Meta-Reviewer: Finally, Review 3 suggests some minor revisions but recommends accepting the paper. Can you tell me more about the suggested revisions?

Dialogue Agent: The first suggestion is to revisit the main hypotheses in the results section to provide a clearer statement of how they were confirmed or rejected. The second suggestion is to add a slight dodge in the x-axis of the charts showing trial completion time and hover amounts. The third suggestion is a typo correction.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for answering my questions. Based on the reviews and your answers, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I noticed that the confidence ratings of the reviewers vary. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 1 and Review 2 have a confidence rating of 3, and Review 3 has a confidence rating of 4. This variation in confidence ratings may be due to the subjective nature of reviewing and the differences in the expertise and experience of the reviewers. However, a confidence rating of 3 or 4 indicates a fairly high level of confidence in the evaluation of the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your insights. Based on the reviews and your answers, I have decided to accept the paper "Effects of Visual Distinctiveness on Learning and Retrieval in Icon Toolbars".
