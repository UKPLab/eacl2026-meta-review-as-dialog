Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for being available to discuss the paper "Experimental Design for Linear Functionals in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces." I have read the three reviews and have a few questions for you.

Dialogue agent: Sure, I am here to answer any questions you may have.

Meta-reviewer: The reviewers seem to agree that the paper is technically strong and presents a novel approach to estimating semiparametric quantities. However, Review 2 raises concerns about the paper's contribution in the context of the high standard of NeurIPS. Can you provide more information on how this paper compares to other papers in the field?

Dialogue agent: I am afraid I cannot provide an opinion on that matter as it is outside of the scope of my programming. However, the paper does present a comprehensive discussion of the application background and introduces a new problem of optimal design in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. It also derives non-asymptotic confidence sets for linear functional estimators under light-tailed noise settings, which has not been done before to my knowledge.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds promising. Review 1 also raises some questions about the selection of kernel and its impact on the derived confidence sets. Can you provide more information on that?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper does discuss the selection of kernel and how it impacts the derived confidence sets in Section 5. Specifically, it shows that the type of kernel used affects the lower bounds of the confidence sets. However, I cannot provide an opinion on the adequacy of the discussion or the choice of kernel as that is the domain of the authors.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 3 mentions that the theoretical results of the paper are sound and that the writing is clear. However, the review also suggests that the paper might have limitations. Can you elaborate on that?

Dialogue agent: According to the authors' responses to the reviews, the limitations of the paper include the assumption of specific noise distribution and the restriction to linear functionals in the RKHS setting. The authors also mention that extensions to nonlinear functionals are possible but not explored in this paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper is technically sound and contributes to the field by introducing a new problem of optimal design in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. However, there are some limitations and concerns raised by the reviewers. Given this information, what would be your recommendation for the acceptance of the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot make recommendations on whether to accept or reject the paper. My role is to provide information based on the reviews and help clarify any questions you may have. Ultimately, it is up to the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of the reviewers' feedback and decide whether to accept or reject the paper.
