Decision Maker: Hello. I'm here to discuss the topic of diplomacy with Iran. Can you tell me which side is right?

Dialogue Agent: I'm sorry, but I cannot take sides in this debate. However, I can provide you with the arguments presented by both sides.

Decision Maker: Alright. So, what are the arguments for the side that says diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere?

Dialogue Agent: According to that side, the current state of affairs is that the Obama Administration has privately and publicly offered direct, unconditional talks to the Iranian regime. The Iranian regime has failed to respond. So as of now, there is no diplomacy with Iran. There are no talks.

Decision Maker: What do the "against" side say?

Dialogue Agent: The "against" side argues that it’s very difficult to say that diplomacy is going nowhere with Iran when we haven’t started diplomacy with Iran. They also emphasize the potential for a peaceful resolution.

Decision Maker: Hmm, it seems like both sides have valid points. Can you provide more information about the history of negotiating with Iran?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Liz from the "against" side went through the decades of efforts to negotiate and deal with Iran. It's important to evaluate this history as well as recent signals that this administration has sent to Iran, even before this administration took power.

Decision Maker: That's helpful. Do you have any more information about recent signals sent to Iran?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, according to the "for" side, the Obama Administration has privately and publicly offered direct, unconditional talks to the Iranian regime, but the regime has failed to respond.

Decision Maker: I see. Based on the arguments presented, I think I need more information before making a decision.

Dialogue Agent: Of course. It's important to take into account both sides of the debate and any additional information before coming to a conclusion.
