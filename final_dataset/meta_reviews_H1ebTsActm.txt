 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper about the adaptivity of deep ReLU networks for learning in Besov and mixed smooth Besov spaces. What are your thoughts on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper presents rates of convergence for estimating nonparametric functions in Besov spaces using deep NNs with ReLu activations. The authors show that deep ReLU networks, unlike linear smoothers, can achieve minimax optimality. However, the total rate of convergence has not been presented in a transparent way, and the approximation error has not been clarified.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the mixed Besov spaces and how they compare to Holder/Sobolev classes?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the mixed Besov spaces enable better bounds, but the condition appears quite strong. In comparison, Holder/Sobolev classes have a more relaxed condition, but the bounds are not as tight. The authors claim that the approximation error does not depend on the dimensionality, but one reviewer noted that the approximation error is actually becoming smaller with d for m-Besov spaces.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the clarity and originality of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The reviews mention that the paper is dense and somewhat inaccessible, with a lack of exposition and comparisons with existing results. However, the paper is clearly written, and the authors define Besov spaces and related literature carefully. The paper is original in that it connects network parameters such as depth, width, and sparsity to classical function spaces, which could lead to novel insights into how and why these networks work.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: What about the generalization bounds in Section 4? Do they provide a useful perspective on the results?

Dialogue Agent: One reviewer noted that the generalization bounds in Section 4 are given for an ideal estimator, which is probably impossible to compute. However, the bounds provide a useful perspective on the results and highlight the importance of considering the estimation error and approximation error simultaneously.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on the reviews, I will consider the importance of reviewer confidence and weigh the trade-offs between estimation error and approximation error when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome. I hope this information has been helpful in your decision-making process.
