Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Instance-Dependent Policy Learning for Linear MDPs via Online Experiment Design". Can you give me some information about the reviews and address any concerns or weaknesses mentioned by the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Reviewers 1 and 2 both gave positive feedback on the paper, with Reviewer 1 mentioning some weaknesses related to assumptions made in the paper, specifically the assumption that the policy set has a finite cardinality, and the lack of clear explanation for the instance-dependent term in Theorem 1. In response to these concerns, the authors provided clarification on the assumptions in the rebuttal and included more details in the paper on the instance-dependent term. Reviewer 2 also noted computational efficiency as an area for improvement in the algorithm.

Reviewer 3 also gave positive feedback but mentioned concerns related to the tightness of the instance-dependence and the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The authors addressed these concerns in their response, mentioning that they plan to study these areas of improvement in future work.

Overall, the reviewers were impressed with the novelty and originality of the paper and found it to be technically strong, with excellent impact on at least one area. However, there were some areas for improvement related to assumptions made in the paper and computational efficiency of the algorithm.
