Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in buying the Opteka 0.20X Professional Super AF Fisheye Lens for my Nikon D3200, but I have a few questions. 

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I'm here to help. What would you like to know? 

Buyer: I don't fully understand fisheye lenses. Can you explain the differences between this lens and a regular lens? 

Dialogue Agent: Sure, fisheye lenses are ultra-wide-angle lenses that create a wide field of view. This particular lens has a nearly 180-degree field of view, which means you can capture a lot more in your photographs than you could with a regular lens. It creates a distorted and curvy effect, which some photographers enjoy for creative purposes. 

Buyer: That sounds interesting. Will it work with all my Nikon cameras? 

Dialogue Agent: Yes, it's compatible with a wide range of Nikon cameras, including D4s, D4, D3x, Df, D810, D800, D750, D610, D600, D7200, D7100, D7000, D5500, D5300, D5200, D5100, D3300, D3200, and D3100 Digital SLR Cameras. 

Buyer: Can I use it on any lens or do I need to buy a specific one? 

Dialogue Agent: It screws into the front of any lens, but the distortion is most noticeable under 40mm. Over 40mm still gives you a very wide angle. It comes with different adapters for different lenses sizes, so you should be able to find one that fits your lens. 

Buyer: That's good to know. What else should I know about this lens before buying it? 

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the Opteka HD² 0.20X Professional Super AF Fisheye Lens is beautiful and is of very high quality. It's a great way to get into super wide angle photography with a minimal investment, and the adapter is easy to add and remove, and adds functionality to your existing lenses. However, some users have reported that it's not a real fisheye lens and that the performance is not on par with more expensive lenses. 

Buyer: Hmm, that's interesting. I'm still not sure if I should buy it or not. 

Dialogue Agent: I understand. It's ultimately up to you to decide if this lens is the right fit for your needs. Keep in mind that some users have found it to be a great option for experimentation and fun, while others have been disappointed with its performance compared to more expensive fisheye lenses. 

Buyer: Thanks for the information. I think I'll take some time to think about it before making a decision. 

Dialogue Agent: Not a problem at all. Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.
