Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the paper "On Non-Linear operators for Geometric Deep Learning" and I have three reviews to discuss with you. How confident are you in the ratings and comments made by the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Hello, Meta-Reviewer. I am confident in the ratings and comments made by the reviewers as they are experts in their fields and their comments are valuable for the final decision. However, I cannot provide any opinion or recommendation on the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. So the first review praised the paper for its well-written theory and novel results, but raised a question on whether it is possible to find non-linear operators that commute with specific symmetry groups. Do you think this is a valid concern?

Dialogue Agent: The question raised by Review 1 is valid, but I cannot provide any opinion on it. The author may consider addressing it in future work.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. The second review stated that the paper is well-written and well-motivated, but lacked experiments to verify the proposed theorems, as well as limitations that were not explicitly discussed. What do you think about this?

Dialogue Agent: The lack of experiments and unaddressed limitations are valid concerns raised by Review 2. However, I cannot provide any opinion on whether these concerns are critical or not.

Meta-Reviewer: I understand. Finally, the third review praised the paper for its contribution to the practice of using non-linear activation functions in geometric deep learning, but stated that the paper is very dense mathematically and difficult to read for someone not familiar with the topic. Do you think this is a valid comment?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the difficulty of the paper for someone not familiar with the topic is a valid comment raised by Review 3. However, the significance, quality, and originality of the paper were also praised in the review.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses, dialogue agent. Based on the reviews, I would say that the paper is technically solid and addresses important issues in symmetries in machine learning. However, there are concerns on the lack of experiments, unaddressed limitations, and difficulty in understanding the paper. I think I will accept the paper with a rating of 6, as suggested by Review 3.

Dialogue Agent: Understood, Meta-Reviewer. I will forward your decision to the authors. Thank you for your time.
