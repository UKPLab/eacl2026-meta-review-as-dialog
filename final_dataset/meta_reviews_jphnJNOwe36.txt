Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "Overparameterisation and worst-case generalisation: friend or foe?" and I have a few questions before I decide whether to accept or reject it. 

Dialogue agent: Hello, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. 

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 recommends acceptance, but expresses concern about the limited scope of the experiments. Can you explain why the experiments were limited to only three synthetic datasets and two models? 

Dialogue agent: The goal of our paper was to focus on the worst-case generalization performance of overparameterized models and to evaluate the effectiveness of two simple post-hoc processing techniques on that performance. We chose to use synthetic datasets to provide a controlled and reproducible setting to evaluate these techniques. We also chose to use ResNet and Logistic Regression models because they are widely used in machine learning and represent different model families. 

Meta-reviewer: That makes sense. Review 2, while acknowledging the paper's interesting topic, finds the results not significant enough to warrant publication. Can you respond to that? 

Dialogue agent: We believe our paper adds significant value to the ongoing discussion about worst-case generalization in overparameterized models. We demonstrate that post-hoc processing techniques can improve the worst-case subgroup error of these models, and our results are competitive with state-of-the-art techniques like DRO. We also believe that our paper provides important insights into how machine learning practitioners can address the issue of poor worst-group performance in their models. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your response. Review 3 acknowledges the relevance and timeliness of the paper's topic, but notes that the evaluation is somewhat limited. Can you comment on that? 

Dialogue agent: We acknowledge that our evaluation is limited to synthetic datasets and two specific models. However, our goal was not to provide a comprehensive evaluation across all models and datasets. Rather, we aimed to provide a proof of concept that post-hoc processing techniques can improve worst-case subgroup error in overparameterized models, and we believe our results demonstrate that. We hope that future work will build upon our findings and further explore the effectiveness of these techniques on a wider range of models and datasets. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for addressing these concerns. Based on these reviews and your responses, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. Is there anything else you would like to add or clarify? 

Dialogue agent: No, I believe we have addressed all the questions and concerns raised in the reviews. Thank you for considering our paper for acceptance.
