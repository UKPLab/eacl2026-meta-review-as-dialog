Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today to discuss the paper "Resolving the data ambiguity for periodic crystals". Based on the reviews, it seems to be a technically solid paper with moderate-to-high impact potential. However, there are some concerns raised by the reviewers that need to be addressed. Can you provide me with some more details about the paper?

Dialogue agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. The paper presents a method based on the Point-wise Distance Distribution PDD(S; k) to describe/characterize periodic crystal arrangements. Essentially, it aims to find a function I on all periodic sets of unlabeled points in Rn such that invariance, completeness, metricity, continuity, computability and inverse design criteria hold. The method has been applied to identify instances of similar periodic crystal patterns in large datasets, specifically on atomic crystal configurations from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC).

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. Reviewer 1 mentioned that the method apparently works well for indexing crystals, but expressed concerns about relevance to general deep learning, and limitations to periodic atomic crystal structures. Can you shed some more light on that?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 is correct in saying that predicting periodic crystal structures is a niche domain, and therefore, the relevance of this method to general deep learning could be questioned. However, the paper does provide solid proofs for the method, which gives it strength. Also, it is important to note that the paper only deals with periodic atomic crystal structures because that's the target domain of study.

Meta-reviewer: That makes sense. Moving on, Reviewer 2 mentioned some strengths and weaknesses, one of which being the limited evaluation, as the experiments were only done on one database. Can you elaborate?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Reviewer 2 is correct in saying that the evaluation of the method, while technically solid, was limited to using just one database. Therefore, the impact of this method outside of this database cannot be accurately assessed. However, the strength of the proposed descriptor should not be ignored, and the method could be tested on other material databases to remove variance of experiments.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Finally, Reviewer 3 brought up some concerns about the originality of the method, as well as potential issues with false positives and false negatives. How would you address these concerns?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 3 is correct in saying that the idea of using k-nearest pairwise distances is not new, as it has already been proposed in other methods. However, the false negatives are addressed in the method, and any two periodic structures that are same will have the same output with the proposed descriptor without false negatives. As for the concerns about false positives, this can be resolved by choosing the optimal k to minimize the false positive rate. However, a large value of k will increase the time-complexity at least linearly. It is important to keep in mind that the method provides a robust feature that effectively describes the geometry with the same label for any periodic material with the same geometry.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses, dialogue agent. Based on the reviews that we have gone through, it seems that the paper is technically solid with some minor concerns and limitations. I am fairly confident in my assessment but not entirely certain. I will weigh the importance of each reviewer's confidence ratings, and make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper accordingly. Thank you for your help.
