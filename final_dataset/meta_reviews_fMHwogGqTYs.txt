Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Can you give me an overview of the paper, "Identifying Coarse-grained Independent Causal Mechanisms with Self-supervision," and its reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The paper proposes a method for coarsely disentangling a data-generating process into independent and shared modules. They use a mixture prior to model separate ICMs within a single architecture, chosen to be a GAN, and combine the GAN loss with self-supervision. The paper claims to prove a notion of identifiability of the coarse-grained modules and conducts experiments on variations of MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, comparing their method against vanilla and disentangled VAE variants on some downstream tasks. The reviews are mixed, with one reviewer recommending rejection due to errors and inconsistencies, one strongly rejecting due to an invalid assumption, and one marginally below acceptance threshold due to the method being incremental to existing disentangled representation learning methods except for the mixture prior.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that. Can you address the concerns raised by the reviewers about the paper's assumptions and descriptions of causal mechanisms?

Dialogue Agent: One reviewer questioned the paper's assumption of ICM-conditioned mechanisms and its connection to independent autonomous mechanisms in the literature. While independent autonomous mechanisms in the literature refer to the independence of each sub-modules in a whole generating process, this paper considers a different setting where the generative mechanisms are different for different data groups. We acknowledge that the terminologies used might have caused confusion and clarify that our ICM-conditioned mechanisms refer to the combination of shared mechanisms and ICMs. Another reviewer questioned the implementation of the isolation constraint and its mathematical translation. We clarify that the isolation constraint is enforced by the structure of the mixture prior, which specifies that each ICM and the shared mechanism only affect a subset of the latent variables. The posterior distribution of $p(z_{M_k}|x_{M_k})$ is learned by the same encoder E. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see, thank you for the clarification. Can you also address the concerns about the experiment's limited applicability and the paper's incremental contribution?

Dialogue Agent: We acknowledge that our method requires prior knowledge of the number of generating mechanisms, which may limit its applicability in some scenarios. However, we argue that our work contributes to the field by proposing a new way of modeling ICMs and shared mechanisms using a mixture prior within a single architecture and proving a novel notion of identifiability. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in learning independent mechanisms and improving robustness against intervention, covariate shift, and noise, which has not been achieved by existing disentangled representation learning methods. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. How confident are you in addressing the reviewers' concerns and in the paper's overall evaluation?

Dialogue Agent: While we are confident in addressing the reviewers' concerns, we acknowledge that our method and experiments may be limited in their generalizability and applicability. We would appreciate any feedback on how we can improve our work.
