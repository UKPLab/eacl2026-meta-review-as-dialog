Meta-Reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Intrinsic Social Motivation via Causal Influence in Multi-Agent RL". I see that there are different opinions among the reviewers. Reviewer 1 has some confusion regarding the causal modelling decisions in the paper, but overall finds the approach interesting. Reviewer 2 thinks that there is missing discussion of literature, and also finds the results thin. On the other hand, Reviewer 3 finds the paper's proposed approach valuable and discusses the underlying work in great detail.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for the summary, meta-reviewer. Can you tell me what type of paper this is and what the reviews' ratings and confidence levels are?

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, the paper type is "long", and Reviewer 1's rating is 5, which is marginally below the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 3. Reviewer 2's rating is 4, which means "ok but not good enough - rejection", with a confidence level of 5. Reviewer 3's rating is 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 3.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you, meta-reviewer. Based on the reviews you have summarized, how do you intend to proceed with the paper?

Meta-Reviewer: As a meta-reviewer, I have to make the final decision based on the reviews and my assessment of their expertise. I am concerned about Reviewer 2's criticism that the paper does not discuss much of the literature on reward shaping and lacks formal theory. Hence, I would like to ask you, the dialogue agent, whether the paper addresses these concerns and whether it provides enough novelty and experimental evidence to support the proposed approach.

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that the paper introduces a new intrinsic reward for MARL, representing the causal influence of an agent’s action on another agent counterfactually. The authors show that this reward is related to maximizing the mutual information between agents’ actions, and that agents using this reward cooperate and communicate better in social dilemmas, especially if given an explicit communication channel. 

The authors also equip the agents with an internal Model of Other Agents (MOA) that predicts the actions of other agents and simulates counterfactuals, allowing the method to run in a decentralized fashion and without access to other agents’ reward functions. The paper proposes an interesting approach that extends ideas from single agent RL to multi-agent RL and focuses on cooperative environments, which is an underfocused area in RL right now. 

However, Reviewer 2 is right that the paper lacks discussions of related literature and formal theory, and that the experiments are simple and span a small set of environments. Nevertheless, the authors' proposed augmentation to reward shaping can work better than other methods in coordination games and has the appealing property that it does not require the ability to observe other agents' rewards, as prosociality does. 

Finally, the authors connect the proposed reward shaping to "how humans learn" and draw parallels to newborn infants' sensitivity to correspondences between their actions and others, which Reviewer 2 finds grandiose and unsupported. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. I have to carefully weigh the novelty, relevance, and significance of the paper against the concerns raised by the reviewers. Thank you for reminding me of the paper's main contributions, the reviewers' criticisms, and the limits of your responses. I will consider them in making my decision.
