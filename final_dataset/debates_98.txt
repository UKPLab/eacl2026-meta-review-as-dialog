Decision Maker: Hi there. Can you explain to me what the debate is about?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. The debate is about whether Google violates its "Don't Do Evil" motto.

Decision Maker: Can you give me some arguments for the "For" side?

Dialogue Agent: One argument presented was that if you search for information on topics like Tibetan independence or human rights within China using Google, you will not get the full picture, as they have custom-built a distorted lens for the Chinese market.

Decision Maker: That's interesting. What about arguments for the "Against" side?

Dialogue Agent: One argument presented was that Google is not evil and that they bring information and empowerment to the masses in ways we couldn't have imagined just a few years ago. They also argue that there are complaints about Google, but they are actually making materials more valuable for copyright holders and using trademarks appropriately.

Decision Maker: Okay, thanks. Can you give me more arguments for the "For" side?

Dialogue Agent: That argument also suggested that it's important to recognize that the debate is not about whether Google is a great company or does more good than evil, but about whether they violate their own motto. It's argued that if Google wants to keep its reputation as a company with integrity, it needs to be held accountable for violating its own motto.

Decision Maker: Okay. And what about arguments for the "Against" side?

Dialogue Agent: Another argument for the "Against" side was that Google is not evil, and that calling it so would require a redefinition of terms, that "evil" is best reserved for historical dictators like Hitler or Stalin. It was suggested that the "Don't Do Evil" motto may have been intended to mean something more like "Let's not be a greasy corporation."

Decision Maker: Alright. I think I have a good understanding of both sides now. Thank you for your help.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome. Remember, my role is to remain neutral and provide information, not make a decision for you.
