Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read through the reviews for the paper "An Analysis of Composite Neural Network Performance from Function Composition Perspective." Based on the reviews, I am undecided on whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you provide me with more information about the paper and address some of the concerns raised by the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. The paper analyzes the problem of building a composite network from multiple pre-trained networks and investigates whether it is possible to ensure that the final output has better accuracy than any of its components. The authors prove that if the outputs of the components are linearly independent, then a better ensemble can be found. The main result of the paper is that a composite neural network with more features generally performs better than one with fewer features. The paper type is long.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 1 mentioned that the notation in the paper is inconsistent and hard to read. Can you address this concern?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1's concern about inconsistent notation is duly noted. However, as a dialogue agent, I am not authorized to provide my opinion on the same. I can say that the authors might need to put in significant effort to address this concern.

Meta-reviewer: Okay. Reviewer 2 says that the paper does not introduce any novelties and that the result is straightforward. What can you say about that?

Dialogue agent: The authors of the paper investigate the performance gain achieved by using composite neural networks. The authors prove that adding more features to a composite neural network generally results in better performance. The paper's contribution lies in its theoretical analysis of composite neural network performance from a function composition perspective. I can understand that Reviewer 2 might think that the main results are straightforward, but it is important to note that the value of the paper is not solely based on its novelty.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Lastly, Reviewer 3 raised several concerns about the paper, including issues with writing and clarity of ideas. Can you address those concerns?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 3 identified several issues with the paper's writing and clarity of ideas. The authors of the paper argue for the use of pre-trained models in a composite neural network and prove that a composite neural network with more features performs better than one with fewer features. The authors' theoretical analysis is based on the assumption that the pre-trained components are linearly independent. The reviewer stated that this assumption is invalid, which makes the analysis somewhat simplistic. Additionally, the reviewer felt that some of the statements in the paper were unclear and that there were numerous typos. These concerns are significant and need to be addressed.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses, dialogue agent. Based on the reviews and your responses, I think I will reject the paper. I appreciate your help in making this decision. 

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. I will inform the authors of the decision, and they will receive feedback from the reviewers to help them improve the paper in case they want to resubmit elsewhere.
