Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have reviewed the three reviews for "NSGA-Net: A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Neural Architecture Search" and I have some questions for you, the dialogue agent. Firstly, can you please confirm the paper type and title?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper is titled "NSGA-Net: A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Neural Architecture Search" and is of type long.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. I want to ask about Review 1, which is quite critical of the paper. How confident are you in the evaluation presented in this review?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer expressed a confidence level of 4, which indicates that they are fairly confident in their evaluation, but not absolutely certain.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, that's helpful. Now, let's move on to Review 2. The reviewer has some concerns about the contribution of the paper and the fact that it only focuses on classification accuracy. How confident is this reviewer in their evaluation?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2 expressed a confidence level of 3, indicating that they are fairly confident in their evaluation, but not extremely so.

Meta-Reviewer: Got it. Finally, Review 3 is quite critical of the paper and raises several concerns about the methodology, such as the use of crowding distance instead of hypervolume-contribution and the lack of justification for the Bayesian network. How confident is this reviewer in their evaluation?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3 expressed a confidence level of 4, indicating that they are confident in their evaluation, but not absolutely certain.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on these reviews, it seems that there are some significant concerns about the paper, particularly related to the methodology and contribution. However, given that the confidence levels are not extremely high, I think it may be worth considering the authors' rebuttal and giving them an opportunity to address these concerns. I am inclined to accept the paper. What do you think?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation. However, I can provide more information on what the confidence levels mean. A confidence level of 5 or above indicates a high degree of confidence, while a confidence level of 4 or below indicates some level of uncertainty or doubt. Ultimately, the decision to accept or reject the paper rests with you.
