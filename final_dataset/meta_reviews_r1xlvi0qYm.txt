Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you tell me about the main contributions of the paper "Learning to Remember More with Less Memorization"?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper proposes two methods, Uniform Writing and Cached Uniform Writing, to improve memory writing in memory augmented neural networks. The authors also derive a theoretical formulation of the "remembering" capability of RNNs and evaluate their proposed methods on a range of tasks, including document classification and image recognition from MNIST dataset.

Meta-reviewer: Can you provide more information on the evaluations and results?

Dialogue agent: The results are convincing overall, especially for Cached Uniform Writing (CUW). One reviewer suggested that an analysis part discussing the memory write operations in each task would have been beneficial for the audience, and probably help the meta-reviewer to decide on the acceptance of the paper. Another reviewer complemented the paper for having a nice balance of theoretical motivation and experiments and suggested that including error bars and sweeping for the best hyperparameters would be useful.

Meta-reviewer: How confident are the reviewers in their evaluation and recommendation for acceptance?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 gave a rating of 7 and was fairly confident in the evaluation, while reviewer 2 gave a rating of 8 and was confident but not absolutely certain. Reviewer 3 also gave a rating of 7 and was confident but borderline due to some unclear points and missing experiments.

Meta-reviewer: Can you elaborate on the missing experiments?

Dialogue agent: One reviewer suggested that adding Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) experiments would be useful and could potentially outperform CUW. The reviewer noted that ACT is attempting to solve the same problem as the paper, so including it as a baseline or explaining why it is not an appropriate comparison would clarify the contribution of the paper.

Meta-reviewer: I see. It seems like the reviewers are generally positive about the paper, with some suggestions for improvement. Based on the reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I am curious about the confidence levels of the reviewers. Reviewer 2 was more confident than Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 was borderline due to missing experiments. Can you quantify the overall level of confidence?

Dialogue agent: Based on the ratings and comments from all three reviewers, the overall level of confidence in the evaluation and recommendation for acceptance is moderate to high.
