Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Rethinking Self-driving: Multi-task Knowledge for Better Generalization and Accident Explanation Ability" and I am trying to decide whether to accept or reject it. Can you provide me with some information regarding the paper and its reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. The paper proposes a multi-task convolutional neural network architecture for end-to-end driving, evaluated using the CARLA open source simulator. The paper has received three reviews, one of which rates it as "Ok but not good enough - rejection", and the other two rate it as "Clear rejection".

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you give me some more details on the reviews and their concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 raises concerns about the novelty of the paper's approach, stating that multi-task, especially segmentation, is not novel for self-driving car prediction. The reviewer also points out several minor typos and states that the paper is not good enough for publication at ICLR. Review 2 points out that the paper is littered with typos and grammatical errors, making it hard to read. The reviewer also questions the novelty of the paper's approach compared to prior works and believes it is not suitable for publication at ICLR. Review 3 notes that the paper lacks novelty and insights compared to prior works, and its writing needs serious attention. Furthermore, the reviewer is concerned about the lack of details on the deep net architecture and the release of the perception training dataset. The reviewer also believes that the paper is not suitable for publication at ICLR.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on these reviews, I am concerned about the validity and novelty of the paper's approach. However, I want to know the confidence levels of the reviewers.

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 has a confidence level of 4, indicating that they are confident but not absolutely certain about their evaluation. Reviewer 2 has a confidence level of 5, indicating that they are absolutely certain that their evaluation is correct. Reviewer 3 has a confidence level of 4, indicating that they are confident but not absolutely certain about their evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Given the concerns and confidence levels of the reviewers, I am leaning towards rejecting the paper. However, I will evaluate the paper myself and make a final decision. Thank you for your assistance, dialogue agent.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. Let me know if you need any further assistance.
