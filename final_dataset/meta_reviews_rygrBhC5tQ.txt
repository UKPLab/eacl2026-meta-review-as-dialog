 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Composing Complex Skills by Learning Transition Policies":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Composing Complex Skills by Learning Transition Policies". Can you tell me a little bit about the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper proposes a scheme for transitioning to favorable starting states for executing given options in continuous domains. The authors use two learning processes simultaneously: one learns a proximity function to favorable states from previous trajectories and executions of the option, and the other learns the transition policies based on dense reward provided by the proximity function.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the choice of exponential ("discounted") proximity function? I'm curious about why the authors chose this particular function over a linear function of "step"?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors chose the exponential proximity function because it allows for a more natural way of defining the distance between states, especially when considering the number of steps away. However, the reviewer raises a valid point about the choice of the proximity function, and it would be interesting to see the authors elaborate on this aspect.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the evaluations performed in the paper? How did the authors assess the effectiveness of their method?

Dialogue Agent: The authors evaluated their method on several MojoCo tasks, including locomotion and manipulation. They used comprehensive evaluations over several tasks and several baselines to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method. The results suggest that the scheme works well and does not get stuck in local minima.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds promising. Can you tell me more about the weaknesses and limits of the method, as raised by one of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! One of the reviewers raised questions about the consistency of the metapolicy, specifically asking what ensures consistency in the consecutive steps. Additionally, the reviewer noted that the method may have weaknesses and limits, but the authors do not address these concerns explicitly.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and the information you provided, I would like to make a final decision on the paper. Can you provide a summary of the reviews and the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The reviews for the paper are generally positive, with one reviewer noting that the method is well-motivated and relevant, while another reviewer raised some questions about the choice of the proximity function and the consistency of the metapolicy. The main contributions of the paper include proposing a scheme for transitioning to favorable starting states for executing given options in continuous domains, using two learning processes simultaneously, and evaluating the effectiveness of their method on several MojoCo tasks.

Final Decision:

Based on the reviews and the information provided by the dialogue agent, the meta-reviewer decides to accept the paper with a rating of 7 and a confidence level of 4. The meta-reviewer notes that the paper is well-written, features an extensive set of experiments, and presents an elegant approach to learning transition policies for complex tasks. However, the meta-reviewer also notes that the choice of the proximity function may be a potential weakness of the method and raises some questions about the consistency of the metapolicy.
