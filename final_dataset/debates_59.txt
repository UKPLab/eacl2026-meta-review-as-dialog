DM: Hello, I am here to learn more about the debate topic, "Global warming is not a crisis". Can you provide me with information about both sides of the argument?

DA: Of course, for the "For" side, they argue that global warming is not a crisis at present, and much of the current alarm is based on ignorance of what is normal for weather and climate. They suggest that extreme weather events occur all the time and there is no evidence of systematic increases. Additionally, sea level has been increasing since the end of the last Ice Age glaciation, and the impact of warming on agriculture and disease seems dubious at best.

On the other side, the "Against" arguments state that global warming is indeed a crisis in the sense that it is a turning point, a state of affairs in which a decisive change for better or worse is imminent. They argue that science has proven the reality of global warming and that mankind's fingerprints have now clearly emerged above the noise of natural variability. They also mention the increasing frequency of heat waves, higher sea levels, and vanishing glaciers as evidence of the severity of the situation.

DM: Thank you for providing that information. Can you tell me about any projections or forecasts related to global warming?

DA: Yes, the "Against" side states that they project a further warming of a half a degree Fahrenheit for the next twenty-five years. Beyond that, it largely depends on how much more CO2 and other greenhouse gases humanity dumps into the atmosphere. They also warn that continuing to fuel the world using present technology will bring dangerous and possibly surprising climate changes by the end of this century if not sooner. 

DM: What is the scientific community's stance on global warming?

DA: The "Against" side argues that the science community today has impeccable settled science that demonstrates the reality of global warming and its primary origin in human activities. They also mention the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report and the extensive process of experts who represent mainstream science.

On the other hand, the "For" side acknowledges that even their opponents do not claim that global warming is a crisis at present, and suggest that the impact of CO2 per unit CO2 actually goes down with increasing CO2. They also argue that it is crucial to distinguish between the claim that models can display past behavior from the actual situation, which is that models can be adjusted to display past behavior once that behavior is known. 

DM: Thank you for the information. Based on both sides of the argument, what do you suggest is the conclusion?

DA: As a dialogue agent, I cannot express opinions or make decisions. However, I provided the arguments from both sides that may help you reach your own conclusion.
