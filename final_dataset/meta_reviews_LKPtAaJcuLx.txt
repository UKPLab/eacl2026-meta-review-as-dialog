Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the reviews. Based on the feedback provided, I have some questions for the dialogue agent regarding the paper's reviews. 

Dialogue Agent: I'm here to answer your questions. Please go ahead.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 mentions that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods in terms of point log-likelihood, perplexity, topic diversity, clustering purity/NMI, diversity of generated topics, and visual separability on topic embeddings. Can you confirm if these results are consistent across the three datasets?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 1 mentions that the proposed method consistently outperforms the baseline methods on all three datasets. 

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 points out that the paper does not adequately define posterior collapse, and the corresponding measurement and mitigation techniques are not clear. Can you provide more information on how posterior collapse is defined and measured in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 2 makes a valid point regarding the lack of clarity on posterior collapse in the paper. However, I can confirm that the authors have revised the definition of posterior collapse and added a table in the appendix that ties it to the experimental setup.

Meta-reviewer: That's good to hear. Review 3 mentions some limitations of the paper, specifically regarding the experimental section and the use of perplexity as the main evaluation metric. Can you comment on these limitations?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 3 rightly pointed out that the experimental section could be more convincing, especially in terms of using perplexity as the main evaluation metric. However, the authors have conducted thorough experimental studies supporting the claims made in the paper. While they have used perplexity as the main evaluation metric, they have also presented some qualitative results and other measures, such as topic diversity and clustering purity/NMI, which show the benefits of the proposed method. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews and your answers, I am inclined to accept the paper with a weak accept rating. While the paper has some limitations and areas for improvement, the proposed method demonstrates technical solidity and moderate-to-high impact, with no major concerns with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility, or ethical considerations.
