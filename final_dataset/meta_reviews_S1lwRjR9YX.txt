Meta-reviewer: Hello there, dialogue agent. I'm reviewing a paper titled "Stability of Stochastic Gradient Method with Momentum for Strongly Convex Loss Functions" for the long paper category. The paper has mixed reviews, and I'm a bit confused about whether to accept or reject it. Can you provide me with more information about the paper?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper analyzes the generalization error of SGD with momentum for strongly convex objectives using the framework of algorithmic stability. It extends a previous result on vanilla SGD and provides an upper-bound on true risk through convergence analysis. The paper also clarifies dependencies of convergence speed on the size of the dataset and the momentum parameter.

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. What type of paper is it, and how were the reviews rated in terms of recommendation and confidence?

Dialogue agent: The paper is of the long paper category. Review 1 rated it as "Ok but not good enough - rejection" with confidence level 5 (absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct) and pointed out concerns regarding the theoretical results' relation to practical values. Review 2 rated it as "Marginally above acceptance threshold" with confidence level 4 (confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct) and appreciated the analysis and the extension of previous results. Review 3 rated it as "Ok but not good enough - rejection" with confidence level 4 (confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct) citing concerns about the theoretical results' limitations and incremental contribution.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the limitations mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Sure. Review 1 expressed concerns about the theoretical results' relation to practical values of the momentum parameter and the lack of a literature survey and precise treatment of related works' assumptions. Review 3 pointed out limitations in the theoretical results' assumptions and the contribution being incremental without clear advantages over SGD in some cases.

Meta-reviewer: Given the reviews, I'm still not sure if I should accept or reject the paper. How would you advise me to proceed?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, my role is to provide you with information and not recommend a decision. However, I can suggest that you carefully consider the limitations mentioned in the reviews and weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in making the final decision.
