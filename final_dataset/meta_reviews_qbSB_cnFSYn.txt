Meta-reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, thank you for joining me today. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper titled "DEQGAN: Learning the Loss Function for PINNs with Generative Adversarial Networks" and I need your assistance in making a decision regarding its acceptance or rejection.

Dialogue agent: Of course, I'm here to help. Can you please provide me with more information about the paper and its reviews?

Meta-reviewer: Sure, the paper proposes a method for solving differential equations using generative adversarial networks (GANs). The authors compare their method against a classical approach and show superior empirical results. However, there are concerns with the theoretical justification of the loss function, training instability, lack of theoretical analysis, and the use of artificial equations with specific initial conditions. Furthermore, some reviewers suggest that the proposed method is not necessarily novel and there is room for improvement in the discussion of the method's limitations.

Dialogue agent: I see. Can you tell me more about the paper's type, and the ratings and confidences of the reviewers?

Meta-reviewer: Yes, the paper is of long type. Reviewer 1 gave a rating of 3, which means they suggest rejecting the paper due to technical flaws and weak evaluation, but they also express confidence of 5, indicating they are absolutely certain about their assessment. Reviewer 2 provided a rating of 7, meaning they recommend accepting the paper due to being technically solid with high impact and excellent evaluation, and they express a confidence of 4, which signifies they are confident but not absolutely certain. Reviewer 3 gave a rating of 7, suggesting acceptance due to technical solidity and high impact, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations. However, they also expressed a moderate confidence of 3.

Dialogue agent: Understood. May I know what is your initial leaning about the acceptance of the paper?

Meta-reviewer: At this point, I am hesitant to make a final decision based on the reviews and my own reading of the paper. While there are some concerns raised by the reviewers, the paper also provides a novel approach that outperforms classical methods, as demonstrated through experiments. Additionally, the paper is well-written and structured, which is a plus factor. I need to deliberate further before coming up with a final decision. Can you provide me with further information about the proposed method?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, it is not within my purview to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can assist you by answering specific questions you may have about the paper to help you come up with a decision that is based on the reviews and your own judgment.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Can you tell me more about the concerns raised by Reviewer 1 regarding the theoretical justification of the loss function and how the discriminator can learn a better objective function?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 mentions that the authors state that L2 loss lacks theoretical justification, but the paper does not provide an explanation on why and when L2 loss can be problematic. Additionally, the learned loss function in DEQGAN is borrowed from the original GAN work and may not necessarily be theoretically justifiable for solving differential equations. The reviewer also suggests that the paper misses important discussion on works that attempt to learn a loss function such as SA-PINNs. Regarding how the discriminator can learn a better objective function, the reviewer does not provide a direct answer to that.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Can you also tell me more about the concerns regarding the training instability and the use of artificial equations with specific initial conditions?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 mentions that DEQGAN has training instability issue and needs to repeat runs multiple times to solve one equation. Additionally, the paper uses artificial equations with only one specific initial condition for each equation, raising the concern that the authors may have picked the initial conditions to put DEQGAN in advantage in the experimental results.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What can you tell me about the reviewers' ratings and confidences? Do you think I should consider the reviewers' confidences when making my decision?

Dialogue agent: The reviewers' ratings and confidences provide valuable insights into the paper's strengths and weaknesses, but ultimately the decision is yours to make. You may take into account the reviewers' confidences if you value their expertise and thoroughness, but it is important to note that confidence levels may not necessarily reflect the validity and reliability of their ratings. It may be helpful to also consider your own expertise in the field and your own understanding of the paper when making the final decision.
