Decision Maker: Good evening. I am here to understand whether Islam is dominated by radicals. Can you give me some information about both sides of the argument?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, of course. Those in favor of the motion argue that there are those within Islam who strive for a version of Islam that denies legal and civic equality to citizens based on religious grounds. They argue that such people dominate the Islam world and use examples of countries such as Pakistan, Sudan, and Nigeria. They are not arguing that most Muslims are radical. On the other hand, those against the motion argue that it is unfair to pass judgment on a billion and a half people in every corner of the world, based on the actions of select individuals or groups. They believe that Islam is diverse and eclectic and should not be categorized or generalized.

Decision Maker: What evidence do those in favor of the motion have to support their argument?

Dialogue Agent: They point to countries such as Pakistan, where blasphemy laws have been introduced, including the death penalty for religious minorities, as evidence of radicalization. They also mention the genocidal wars in Sudan and the conflicts that have taken place in Nigeria over the introduction of Islamic laws. They argue that such trends are growing, even in historically moderate countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia.

Decision Maker: What about those against the motion? What evidence do they have?

Dialogue Agent: They argue that the idea that Islam is dominated by radicals is not based on fieldwork or research but rather on what is reported in the media. They point out that commercial news tends to focus on violence and terror because it sells commercials. They say that Islam is a diverse religion, and it is unfair to generalize based on the actions of a few individuals or groups.

Decision Maker: Based on this information, which side do you think is more convincing?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, it is not my place to make a judgment or express any opinions. My role is to provide information on both sides of the argument. You should weigh the evidence presented by both sides and come to your own conclusion.

Decision Maker: Thank you for your help. I will do my best to make an informed decision.
