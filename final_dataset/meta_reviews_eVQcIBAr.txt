Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. It seems that Review 1 and Review 2 are positive and recommend accepting the paper, while Review 3 has some reservations but also recommends acceptance. Can you confirm that this is the case?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, that is correct.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, thank you. Review 1 provides very detailed feedback and suggestions for improvements. Do you think the authors should address all of these points before accepting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: It's not my place to provide an opinion or recommendation. However, it is worth noting that Review 1 suggests some additions such as a table showing when and how often the different templates were used in a story and highlighting the most surprising findings. These additions may enhance the paper and make it more compelling.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. And what about Review 2's comments on the level of contribution? Do you think this is a significant issue?

Dialogue Agent: Again, I cannot provide an opinion. However, it is worth noting that Review 2 acknowledges the impressive amount of work that went into designing and evaluating Yarn, but raises a concern about the generalizability of the results to other story-sharing support systems.

Meta-Reviewer: I understand. And Review 3 comments on the need for better organization and focus in the paper. Do you think this is a major issue?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 suggests some improvements such as cutting Section 3 and integrating it into the introduction. While this may help improve the focus of the paper, it is up to the authors to decide if they want to make these changes.

Meta-Reviewer: Alright, thank you for providing your clarifications. Based on these reviews, I think the methodology and findings of this paper are strong, but there may be some room for improvement in terms of organization, focus, and generalizability. Overall, I am leaning towards accepting the paper, but I would like to hear your thoughts on the confidence levels of the reviewers.

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 has a confidence level of 5, indicating a high level of certainty in their evaluation. Review 2 has a confidence level of 3, indicating a moderate level of certainty. Review 3 also has a confidence level of 3.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for providing that information. I think the high confidence level of Review 1 and the generally positive feedback from all three reviewers are good indicators that this paper has merit and should be accepted. I will recommend acceptance, but also suggest that the authors consider the suggestions for improvement raised by the reviewers.
