Meta-Reviewer: Hello, can you give me an overview of the reviews for the paper "Convolutional Neural Networks combined with Runge-Kutta Methods"?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Review 1 praises the general idea of the paper but criticizes its lack of clarity and presentation quality. Review 2 highlights the importance of connecting deep nets to dynamical systems but raises concerns about the paper's empirical results and clarity, particularly in relation to connections to the brain. Review 3 deems the paper mathematically sound but suggests improvements in its presentation and raises questions about stability analysis and computational aspects.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What type of paper is it?

Dialogue Agent: The paper is a long paper.

Meta-Reviewer: And the paper's title suggests that it proposes a method of combining convolutional neural networks with Runge-Kutta Methods. Can you tell me if the reviews discuss the method's performance or whether it was compared to other state-of-the-art methods?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 notes that the empirical results could be compelling but points out the paper only compares to a few datasets and doesn't compare extensively to many state-of-the-art methods. However, Review 3 highlights the soundness of the method mathematically and mentions that it presents a nice test case for integrating tools from dynamical systems into deep learning.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Given the reviews, I'm interested to know about reviewer confidence.

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 has a confidence level of 3, marking the reviewer as fairly confident that the evaluation is correct. Review 2 has a confidence level of 4, indicating that the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. Review 3's confidence level is 3, marking the reviewer as fairly confident that the evaluation is correct.

Meta-Reviewer: I appreciate knowing about the reviewer confidence levels. Given the reviews and the type of paper, I'm leaning towards rejecting it. Do you have any other details that could sway me towards accepting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: I apologize, but as a dialogue agent, it is not within my capability to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can provide more details if needed.

Meta-Reviewer: Thanks, it's alright. I'll go through the reviews once more before making the final decision.
