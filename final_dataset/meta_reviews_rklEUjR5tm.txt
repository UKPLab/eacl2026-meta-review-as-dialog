Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Thank you for joining me today. I have reviewed the paper SHE2: Stochastic Hamiltonian Exploration and Exploitation for Derivative-Free Optimization and have some questions based on the reviews.

Dialogue Agent: Of course, Meta-Reviewer. I'm here to answer any questions you have.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 1 seems to have some concerns about benchmarking and the confidence level is at 4, so I'm not sure how much weight to give to this review. Can you provide any insight into how important benchmarking is for this particular paper?

Dialogue Agent: While benchmarking is an important aspect of any optimization algorithm, in this case, it may be more of a suggestion for future work rather than a major concern for the current paper. The paper does compare multiple optimization algorithms, including some well-accepted methods, and provides results on several datasets. However, the reviewer's suggestion to consider benchmarking on the Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking (BBOB) Workshop and its COCO platform may be useful for future work or extensions of the current method.

Meta-Reviewer: That makes sense. Review 2, on the other hand, is very critical and gives a confidence level of 3 for rejection. They raise concerns about technical details and clarity. Can you address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 does raise several valid concerns, and we appreciate the reviewer's detailed feedback. In terms of clarity, the paper could benefit from additional explanation and motivation, especially for the central contribution of the paper. We agree that definition 2 may be confusing and will work to provide additional background information on Su et al. (2014) to give readers a better understanding of the proposed method.

Regarding technical details, the review raises some issues with the inclusion of L-BFGS as a "derivative free" baseline and the claim that the authors' method outperforms derivative-based methods at optimizing convex loss functions. We will review these claims and ensure that the paper accurately represents the capabilities of the proposed method.

Meta-Reviewer: That's great to hear. Now, Review 3 seems to be more positive overall but raises concerns about complexity and provides a list of specific questions. How important are these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 does raise several valid points that could be addressed in future work or extensions of the current method. The concerns about computational complexity and the use of quadratic loss functions are important for understanding the limits of the proposed method. We will ensure that any claims about computational complexity accurately reflect the capabilities of the proposed method and address the concerns raised about the use of quadratic loss functions.

Additionally, the reviewer's questions can provide useful feedback for future work and extensions of the proposed method. We will review the literature cited by the reviewer and provide any necessary clarification or additional explanation in the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your detailed responses, Dialogue Agent. Based on these reviews, I'm leaning towards rejecting this paper. However, I would like to hear your final recommendation before making a decision.

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide a recommendation or opinion on whether to accept or reject the paper. However, I can tell you that the concerns raised by the reviewers should be addressed in the paper to ensure that any claims or conclusions accurately reflect the capabilities of the proposed method. After addressing these concerns, it will be up to the Meta-Reviewer to make the final decision based on the paper's quality and contribution to the field.
