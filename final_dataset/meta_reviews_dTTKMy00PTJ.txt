 Sure! Here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Universal Rates for Interactive Learning":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Universal Rates for Interactive Learning". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper studies the universal learning framework for interactive learning, where the learner is allowed to send binary queries to an oracle. The authors show that interactive learning can achieve better rates than passive learning in certain regimes.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the review process and the confidence of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper received three reviews. Review 1 rated the paper as "Very Strong Accept" with a confidence of 3. Review 2 rated the paper as "Accept" with a confidence of 4. Review 3 rated the paper as "Strong Accept" with a confidence of 3.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. What are the main weaknesses of the paper according to the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers noted that the paper assumes a strong model of interactivity, which may not be practical for all applications. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a discussion of practical aspects, such as the computational requirements of the algorithms.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews and your summarized answers, how would you rate the paper and make a decision?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as "Strong Accept" with a confidence of 3. The paper presents novel results and technical contributions to the field of interactive learning, and the reviewers generally agree on its high impact and quality. However, the reviewers also raise some concerns about the practicality of the algorithms and the strong model of interactivity assumed in the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your assistance. Based on your summarized answers and the reviews, I will make a final decision on the paper.
