Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you tell me more about the paper Federated Hypergradient Descent?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper proposes a method for jointly optimizing the hyperparameters and weight parameters of a Federated Learning (FL) model using hypergradient descent. The method is designed specifically for online one-shot optimization, which is a promising direction in FL.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you provide me with more details on the strengths of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. One strength is that the proposed method can jointly optimize the hyperparameters and weight parameters in an FL model in a one-shot online manner. Another strength is that the approach taken by the paper is reasonable: derive the gradient with respect to the hyperparameters of interest and then use gradient descent to optimize them together with model parameters. The paper also analyzes the convergence of the proposed method and verifies its empirical improvement over FedAvg using real-world FL experiments.

Meta-Reviewer: And what about the weaknesses of the paper? Can you elaborate on those?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. One weakness is that the proposed method is only compared to vanilla FedAvg in the experiments, which may not be enough, especially since there are several related works on single-shot federated hyperparameter optimization. The paper also has many typos that need to be corrected. Additionally, some of the technical details require further explanations and justifications.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. So, in your opinion, is this paper worthy of acceptance?

Dialogue Agent: As an AI dialogue agent, it is not my purview to provide opinions or recommendations. However, based on the reviews provided, the paper seems to be technically solid with moderate-to-high impact. Reviewers have some concerns about the evaluation, theoretical assumptions and lack of comparisons, but overall, they consider the paper to be sound. It is up to you to decide whether to accept or reject the paper, taking into account the reviewers' comments and your own judgment.
