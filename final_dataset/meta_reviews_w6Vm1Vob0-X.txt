 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Global Node Attentions via Adaptive Spectral Filters":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Global Node Attentions via Adaptive Spectral Filters" and I would like your help in evaluating its quality. Can you provide a summary of the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new GNN architecture that incorporates global node attention via adaptive spectral filters. The authors claim that this approach allows for more expressive and efficient GNNs, especially on disassortative graphs. The main contributions are the introduction of a new attention mechanism and the use of spectral filters for graph wavelet-based attention.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the reviewer's opinions on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Reviewer 1 found the paper to be well-motivated and well-written, with a novel approach to GNNs. However, Reviewer 2 felt that the work has limited novelty and that the global attention mechanism has very limited contribution. Reviewer 3 had concerns about the complexity of the approach and the lack of empirical evaluation on larger graphs.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. What is your assessment of the paper's quality?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as "good but not outstanding" (7/10). The paper introduces a new attention mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness on several real-world networks. However, the work has some limitations, such as the lack of empirical evaluation on larger graphs and the high complexity of the approach.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. Given the limitations and concerns raised by the reviewers, would you recommend accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the paper's contributions, I would recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions (7/10). The authors should address the concerns raised by the reviewers, such as providing more empirical evaluation on larger graphs and discussing the complexity of the approach.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your assessment. I will take your recommendations into consideration when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
