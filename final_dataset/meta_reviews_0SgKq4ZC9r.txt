 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Decomposed Knowledge Distillation for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Decomposed Knowledge Distillation for Class-Incremental Semantic Segmentation". Can you tell me what the main contributions of the paper are?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a technique for class-incremental learning in semantic segmentation, which addresses the forgetting problem by decomposing the prediction logit into two terms. It also introduces an auxiliary classifier to improve the rigidity and transfer the knowledge of negatives.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper, in your opinion?

Dialogue Agent: The paper proposes a new distillation method, DKD, to address the forgetting problem. It also provides extensive comparison experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Additionally, the main idea of the paper is easy to understand.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: What about the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The contributions of the paper are somewhat limited, and the motivation of some parts of the paper needs to be provided more clearly. The method requires modifications to the semantic segmentation model, which makes it not applicable to off-the-shelf models. Also, the assumption that new classes rarely appear in old data may not be true for more complex scenes.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on your assessment, would you recommend accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would recommend weakly accepting the paper. The paper has technical solidity and moderate to high impact, but the limitations and weaknesses outweigh the strengths.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. Can you tell me more about the limitations and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The paper has limited evaluation, and the motivation of some parts of the paper needs to be provided more clearly. Additionally, the method requires modifications to the semantic segmentation model, which makes it not applicable to off-the-shelf models. Finally, the assumption that new classes rarely appear in old data may not be true for more complex scenes.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the detailed summary. I think I have a good understanding of the paper now.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help with?
