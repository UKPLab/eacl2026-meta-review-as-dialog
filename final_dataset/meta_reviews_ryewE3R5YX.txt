Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Characterizing Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning," and I'm still unsure whether to accept or reject it. Can you provide me with more information to help me make a decision?

Dialogue Agent: Of course, Meta-Reviewer. What would you like to know?

Meta-Reviewer: First, can you summarize the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper proposes a taxonomy of evasion-time attacks against deep RL and introduces several new attacks, including two heuristics for efficient evasion-time attacks and attacks that target the environment dynamics and RL system’s actions. They also present a catalog of attacks and evaluate the effectiveness of their proposed approaches experimentally on Mujoco tasks and the TORCS driving simulator.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. One of the reviewers mentioned a concern about the lack of discussion on how the attacks are connected to specific threat scenarios in the real world. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: As an AI language model, I can't provide opinions or recommendations, but I can tell you that this was a valid concern raised by the reviewer. The paper does not thoroughly discuss the connections between the attacks and real-world threat scenarios, which may weaken the contribution in terms of security analysis. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Another reviewer raised a concern about the difficulty in understanding the paper's contributions and the need for better experimental results. What can you say about that?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer mentioned that the taxonomizing of evasion-time attacks against deep RL is a valuable contribution, but the paper's technical contributions are not presented clearly, and the experimental results do not support the key contributions of faster attack generation. The reviewer suggests that the paper needs improvement before it can be accepted.

Meta-Reviewer: I understand. And, finally, can you provide any insights into the reviewer confidence levels?

Dialogue Agent: The first and second reviewers expressed a moderate level of confidence in their evaluations, suggesting that they are not absolutely certain about their assessments. The third reviewer has a higher confidence level, but still not as high as they would have liked, specifically due to the broad scope of the paper and unclear presentation of technical contributions and experimental results. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and your explanations, I believe I need to request revisions of the paper before I can make a final decision on acceptance or rejection.
