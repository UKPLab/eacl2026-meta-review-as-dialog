Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in purchasing an optical splitter. Can you tell me more about the product?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, the optical splitter is designed to plug one device into it and split the audio off to two receivers. We have a wide range of options available. Do you have any specific questions?

Buyer: Yes, I would like to know if the product affects the audio quality in any way?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, most customers have not experienced any loss of quality. However, it's essential to ensure that your devices have an 'off' function to prevent audio signals from crossing.

Buyer: That's helpful to know. What about the durability of the product?

Dialogue Agent: The reviews suggest mixed opinions regarding the product's durability. While some customers find it well-built and compact, others feel that it's cheaply made and falls apart after a single use.

Buyer: Hmm, I see. Can you tell me more about its function and compatibility with various devices?

Dialogue Agent: The optical splitter is compatible with any device that has an optical output, such as a cable box, Xbox, and AppleTV. However, some customers have reported issues with signal transmission, especially when using two different sources into one input. It's crucial to check your devices' signal output before purchasing.

Buyer: Thanks for the information. Can you recommend any particular brand or model?

Dialogue Agent: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide any recommendations or opinions. However, I have access to customer reviews that might help you make an informed decision.

Buyer: I understand. Based on the reviews you mentioned, I think I'll take a chance and purchase the product.

Dialogue Agent: That's great to hear. Please let us know if you have any further questions.
