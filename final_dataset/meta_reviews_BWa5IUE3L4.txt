Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the paper "Graph Neural Network Bandits", and I would like to ask some questions to help me make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I'm here to help. What would you like to know?

Meta-Reviewer: First, can you summarize the paper's main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: The paper proposes to address the bandit optimization problem over graph domains using graph neural networks (GNNs) as reward functions. To handle the permutation invariance of graph domains, the paper introduces the permutation-invariant additive kernel and shows that it is the limit of GNNs in the neural tangent kernel regime. The paper establishes upper bounds for maximum information gain, constructs valid confidence sets that utilize GNNs, and proposes an algorithm called GNN-PE to achieve sublinear regret. The paper also provides theoretical proofs and supporting experiments.

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the reviewers' opinions on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 rated the paper a 7, indicating that it is a technically solid paper with high impact on at least one sub-area, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations. The reviewer pointed out that the paper is more towards the theoretical extension of the bandit problem to the graph domain but did not clearly explain the limitations of the results and the assumptions made. Reviewer 2 also rated the paper a 7 and commended the paper for its well-motivated problem, solid theoretical results, and well-written presentation. However, the reviewer noted a lack of examples about the ball in RKHS norm. Reviewer 3 gave the paper a rating of 5, indicating a borderline acceptance. The reviewer appreciated the paper's theoretical insights in using GNNs as permutation invariant reward functions and how to improve bandits in structural domains. However, the reviewer noted the paper's limited interest or impact beyond the bandit area and the absence of insights into common problems in GNNs such as oversmoothing and oversquashing.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that summary. Can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewers 1 and 2 both rated their confidence at 3, indicating that they are fairly confident in their assessment but may not have understood some parts of the submission or are unfamiliar with some related work. Reviewer 3, on the other hand, rated their confidence at 4, indicating that they are confident in their assessment but not absolutely certain and that it is unlikely but not impossible that they did not understand some parts of the paper or are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, thank you for that information. Based on the reviews and your summary, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. However, I am concerned about the reviewers' confidence levels. Do you have any advice on how to overcome this concern?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers' opinions and confidence levels are important to consider, but they should not be the sole criteria in making the decision. You can also look at the paper's technical soundness, relevance, and potential impact. Furthermore, you can encourage the reviewers to provide more details or justification for their ratings and to point out specific aspects of the submission that they find unclear or problematic.
