Meta-reviewer: Hello there, I have reviewed the three reviews for SIXO: Smoothing Inference with Twisted Objectives, and I would like to clarify a few points before making my decision. Dialogue agent, can you provide more information on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Sure, I can provide a summary of the reviews. All three reviewers agree that the paper proposes a novel solution to a long-standing problem and is technically strong. The main idea of the paper is to learn intermediate target distributions to tighten the variational bounds in SMC inference. The authors propose a method called SIXO, which uses density ratio estimation techniques to learn twisting functions that tilt the filtering distributions toward the true smoothing distributions. The paper also demonstrates good experimental results and provides clear figures. Reviewers point out the weakness of SIXO that uses too much static data and cannot be used in streaming scenarios. They also note that the argument for choosing posteriors as a target distribution over filter distributions has limitations in the typical settings where observations are dense in the time domain. Finally, the reviewers suggest minor improvements to the paper, which could be addressed in the revision.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. In your opinion, does the method proposed in this paper provide a significant contribution to the field?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, the method proposed in this paper provides a novel solution to the intermediate target distribution problem, which is a long-standing open question in SMC inference. The empirical results are convincing, showing that SIXO outperforms methods that do not use twisting and that the density-ratio estimation scheme outperforms an unbiased gradient estimator. Moreover, the theoretical properties of the method, such as the tightness of the bound, have also been positively discussed by the reviewers.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your response. I think I have enough information to make my decision. I'm going to accept this paper with a rating of 8: Strong Accept.
