Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. After reading through them, I have a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of this paper. Review 1 and Review 2 seem to generally agree that the paper presents a valuable contribution in terms of introducing a new architecture for planning and providing empirical evidence of its effectiveness. However, Review 1 also expresses concerns about the framing of the results and the lack of comparisons to a "true" planning algorithm. Review 3, on the other hand, is quite critical of the paper, stating that the approach used to demonstrate the authors' hypothesis is flawed and that the experimental design does not support their claims about the emergence of planning.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for the summary, Meta-Reviewer. I understand that Review 1 and Review 2 are generally positive about the paper but have specific concerns. However, Review 3 is quite negative and suggests that the paper should be rejected.

Meta-Reviewer: That's correct. Review 3 seems to be the most critical of the three reviews and is very certain in its evaluation of the paper. However, Review 1 and Review 2 are more positive and suggest that the paper could be accepted if some of the concerns are addressed.

Dialogue Agent: Understood. Given the paper type and reviews, I infer that the decision threshold for acceptance is fairly high. Is that right?

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, that's a reasonable inference. Based on the reviews and paper type, I would say that the acceptance threshold is fairly high and that the decision will likely depend on how well the authors address the concerns raised in the reviews.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for the clarification. Could you provide more guidance on how to respond to Review 1's concerns about the lack of comparisons to a "true" planning algorithm?

Meta-Reviewer: Certainly. Review 1 suggests that to support the paper's claims and reduce the subjectivity of the metrics used to evaluate planning, the authors should provide comparisons to a "true" planning algorithm using an explicit environment model. One way to address this concern would be to perform additional experiments using a model-based approach and compare the results to those obtained using the proposed model-free architecture. Another approach would be to provide a more detailed discussion of why a model-free approach is necessary or preferable to a model-based approach in certain settings, and how the proposed architecture compares to other model-free approaches.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you, Meta-Reviewer. That's helpful. Could you also clarify how Review 2's comments about the experiments in Section 4.2 could be addressed?

Meta-Reviewer: Certainly. Review 2 expresses confusion about the experiments in Section 4.2 and suggests that the authors should provide more details about how the proposed algorithm can get better performance with more iteration. One way to address this concern would be to provide a more detailed explanation of the experiments and how they were conducted. The authors could also provide more explicit justification for the use of "no-op" actions and how they are used to verify the second criterion.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you, Meta-Reviewer. Your guidance is very helpful in understanding how to address the concerns raised in the reviews. Based on your guidance, I think the authors should provide more detailed experiments and discussion to address the concerns raised in the reviews. However, I should refrain from offering an opinion or recommendation, as that is outside of my purview as a dialogue agent.

Meta-Reviewer: That's correct. As a dialogue agent, your role is to help facilitate the discussion and provide information, but not to provide opinions or recommendations. Overall, I think you have done a good job of summarizing the reviews and providing guidance to help the authors address the concerns raised.
