Meta-Reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, I have read the reviews for the paper "Normalization Gradients are Least-squares Residuals" and I'm trying to decide whether to accept or reject it. Can you tell me what the type of the paper is and summarize its main result?

Dialogue Agent: The type of the paper is long. The main result of the paper is the proposal of a new interpretation of batch normalization in neural networks, where backpropagation of the gradient of some loss function through a batch normalization can be seen as a scaled residual of a least-square linear fit. This interpretation is extended to other normalization techniques in the literature and aims to provide a "unified" view of such methods.

Meta-Reviewer: How well-written and easy to follow are the theoretical results and proofs in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 describes the theoretical results and proofs as well written and easy to follow. 

Meta-Reviewer: How convincing are the arguments brought forward by the new vision of batch normalization in applications?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 suggests that the arguments brought forward by the new vision of batch normalization in applications look light, as more detailed interpretation of this new vision on a single application and its impact would have been preferred.

Meta-Reviewer: What is the primary technical contribution of the paper, according to Review 2? 

Dialogue Agent: According to Review 2, the primary technical contribution comes from Section 2, where it is demonstrated that the normalized back-propagated gradients obtained from a BN layer can be viewed as the residuals of the gradients obtained without BN regressed via a simple two-parameter model of the activations. 

Meta-Reviewer: What issue does Review 2 identify regarding the paper's framing of batch normalization as an unsettled issue?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 identifies that the framing of batch normalization as an unsettled issue in motivating the proposed analysis is not fully addressed in the paper's presented interpretation of batch normalization. 

Meta-Reviewer: How does Review 3 describe the novelty and relevance of the proposed interpretation of Batch Normalization?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 indicates that the proposed interpretation holds for any function and can be possibly seen as a gradient pre-conditioning. However, the authors do not "extend" it towards the gradients w.r.t. the network parameters and do not consider the specifics of the learning objectives. 

Meta-Reviewer: Overall, based on the reviews, what is the recommendation for the paper's acceptance or rejection?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Reviews 1 and 2 rate the paper as "Ok but not good enough - rejection" with confidence ratings of 5 and 4, respectively. Review 3 rates the paper as a "Clear rejection" with a confidence rating of 4.
