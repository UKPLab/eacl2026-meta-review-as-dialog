 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "DeVRF: Fast Deformable Voxel Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scenes". The meta-reviewer is aware only of the paper's title, and the dialogue agent is equipped with reviews and paper type information. The output features only the dialogue, without duplicated sentences, and the dialogue agent presents answers in a summarized form without bullet points.

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "DeVRF: Fast Deformable Voxel Radiance Fields for Dynamic Scenes". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a novel view synthesis method for dynamic scenes using a deformable voxel formation. The method is fast and accurate, with a 100x speedup over previous dynamic radiance fields.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with key contributions well formulated and experimented. The dataset used is helpful for quickly starting the research in the dynamic reconstruction paradigm. The method is also able to accurately understand dynamic scenes with a 2-stage capturing procedure.

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me more about the 2-stage capturing procedure?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The 1st stage is to capture a static state with a moving monocular camera, and the 2nd stage is to capture dynamic states with a few fixed cameras. The captured images in the 1st stage are utilized for training the canonical space, while the captured images in the 2nd stage are utilized for training the deformation field.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What are the weaknesses of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The dataset captured in the real world is too small for accurate evaluation, and the method is not generalizable to all dynamic scenes. The synthetic examples shown in the paper are similar to other baselines, making it hard to understand the advantage of the current framework. Additionally, the method is not well suited for real-world applications due to the complicated setup of the capturing strategy.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on these reviews, I would rate this paper as a weak accept. The paper is technically solid, but there are some limitations and weaknesses that need to be addressed.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback. I will pass on your comments to the authors. Is there anything else you would like to know about the paper?
