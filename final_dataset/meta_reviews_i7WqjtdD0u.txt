Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "Continual Learning with Evolving Class Ontologies." I have some questions regarding the paper and the reviews before making my final decision. 

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I'm here to help. What questions do you have?

Meta-reviewer: Can you explain to me the type of the paper and its main title?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper is a long-type submission titled "Continual Learning with Evolving Class Ontologies." The authors propose a solution to the problem of Learning with Evolving Class Ontology (LECO), where the objective is to learn finer classes over time.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. I noticed that Review 1 mentioned a weakness regarding the technical novelty of the proposed solution. Can you confirm if the authors combine existing methods in a novel way, as mentioned in Review 2?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, that is correct. Review 2 acknowledged the novelty of the proposed solution and suggested that the authors could extend their work to multiple time periods or focus on the problem of fine classification with coarse supervision to make their submission stronger.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, I understand. I also noticed Review 3 mentioned that the experimental setup is only for a single time period. Can you clarify if the authors explored the possibility of extending their work to multiple time periods?

Dialogue Agent: The authors didn't mention anything about extending their work to multiple time periods in their submission. Review 3 raised the concern that it might be a weakness of the paper because it's not clear how well the approach generalizes as labels become more fine-grained.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Thank you. Finally, can you tell me if the reviews raised any ethical concerns regarding the authors' work?

Dialogue Agent: No, none of the reviews mentioned any ethical concerns related to the authors' work. Review 1 mentioned that the authors addressed the limitations and potential negative societal impact of their work adequately.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews, I am leaning towards accepting this paper despite some minor weaknesses, as it seems technically solid and has the potential for moderate to high impact. What is your recommendation based on the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I'd say the paper is a borderline accept, with technically solid work where the reasons to accept outweigh the reasons to reject. However, I suggest you use this rating sparingly as it might have limited evaluation according to Reviews 1 and 2.
