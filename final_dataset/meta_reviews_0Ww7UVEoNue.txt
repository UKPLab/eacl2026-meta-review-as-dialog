Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you tell me more about the paper "Active Learning Helps Pretrained Models Learn the Intended Task"?

Dialogue agent: Sure. The paper investigates the use of active learning with pre-trained models to achieve better performance when using uncertainty sampling. The authors perform extensive experiments to evaluate uncertainty sampling approaches for active learning using different pre-trained models and datasets in both vision and natural language tasks.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. Can you elaborate on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue agent: One of the strengths is that the paper is well written and presents clear and thorough experiments. The findings are also interesting, such as the fact that pre-training dataset size matters more than model size. Additionally, pre-trained models can learn a feature space in which the causal and confounding attributes are more linearly separable. As for weaknesses, one reviewer pointed out that some experiments were conventional and that the least confidence heuristic was only effective under certain conditions.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews, it seems that one reviewer gave a high rating while the other two gave borderline ratings. How important is reviewer confidence in your opinion when it comes to making a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer confidence is an important factor to consider, but it should not be the only factor. Ultimately, the decision should be based on the overall quality of the paper, including the methodology, evaluation, and contributions.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Lastly, can you remind me what the type of the paper is?

Dialogue agent: The type of the paper is long.
