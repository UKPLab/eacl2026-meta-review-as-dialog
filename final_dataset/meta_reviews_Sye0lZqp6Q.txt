 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Combining Long Short Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Network for Cross-Sentence n-ary Relation Extraction":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper titled "Combining Long Short Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Network for Cross-Sentence n-ary Relation Extraction". Can you help me understand the paper's main contributions and findings?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a novel approach to cross-sentence relation extraction that combines LSTMs and CNN layers with word and position features. The proposed model shows effective performance on two datasets, outperforming other model choices. The paper also includes interesting analysis and variations, such as showing that an LSTM layer followed by a CNN is a better choice than the other way around.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the reviewer's opinions on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Reviewer 1 thinks that the paper presents a reasonable approach and includes interesting analysis and variations. However, Reviewer 1 notes that there don't appear to be any comparisons to state-of-the-art results on the datasets used. Reviewer 2 finds the paper's experimental study to be well-designed and the results convincing. However, Reviewer 2 has some unclear questions for the authors, such as the meaning of "The use of multiple filters facilitates selection of the most important feature for each feature map" and how the task of predicting n-ary relations is modeled both as a binary and multi-class classification problem. Reviewer 3 enjoys reading the paper and finds it effective in the task, but notes that the proposed model is not very novel and there are some typos and minor issues in the presentation.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Thanks for summarizing the reviews. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper's strengths include its novel approach to cross-sentence relation extraction, effective performance on two datasets, and interesting analysis and variations. However, the paper's weaknesses include the lack of comparisons to state-of-the-art results on the datasets used and some unclear issues and typos in the presentation.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews and your summary, I think I have a good understanding of the paper's contributions and limitations. What is your final recommendation for the paper's acceptance or rejection?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the paper's contributions and limitations, I recommend accepting the paper with a marginally above acceptance threshold confidence. The paper presents a novel approach to cross-sentence relation extraction that shows effective performance on two datasets, and includes interesting analysis and variations. However, the paper could benefit from comparisons to state-of-the-art results on the datasets used and addressing some unclear issues and typos in the presentation.
