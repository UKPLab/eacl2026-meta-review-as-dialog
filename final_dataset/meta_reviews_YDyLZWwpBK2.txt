 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "What Makes a Good Explanation?: A Harmonized View of Properties of Explanations":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "What Makes a Good Explanation?: A Harmonized View of Properties of Explanations". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The authors of this paper provide a comprehensive survey of various explanation properties in the existing literature of explainable artificial intelligence. They focus on two properties in particular: sensitivity and faithfulness, and describe various formulations of the two properties in the literature.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds useful. What are some of the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The survey is quite comprehensive, and provides much-needed links among various works in explainable artificial intelligence. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: What are some of the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors primarily focus on posthoc explanation methods, and ignore the presence of inherently/intrinsically interpretable models in their survey. Additionally, the authors seem to have overlooked some important properties/axioms in XAI, such as the linearity, dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: How do the reviewers rate the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews provided, the ratings vary. Review 1 gives a rating of 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold, while Review 2 gives a rating of 7: Good paper, accept. Review 3 suggests that the paper is a really nice contribution to the workshop, but has some minor suggestions for future iterations.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: What is your assessment of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the content of the paper, I would say that the paper is of good quality and provides a valuable contribution to the field of XAI. However, I agree with the reviewers that the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive literature review and an open questions section in future iterations.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews and your assessment, I will make my final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please feel free to ask me any further questions or seek my assistance in making your decision.
