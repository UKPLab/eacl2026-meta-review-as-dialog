Meta-reviewer: Thank you both for your reviews of "Online Allocation and Learning in the Presence of Strategic Agents." It seems that there are some mixed opinions about the paper's strengths and weaknesses.

Dialogue agent: Yes, it appears so.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 seems to be generally positive and praises the paper for proposing an interesting mechanism to address the ignorance of the valuation distribution. However, Review 1 notes a potential weakness in the paper's approach, namely its reliance on the iid assumption. Do you have any comments on that?

Dialogue agent: I think it's worth noting that our approach is limited by its assumption of identical valuation distributions. While this is a major weakness of our approach in terms of its applicability, it is a necessary assumption to design the proposed mechanism for learning the optimal dual values from the reports while ensuring that the reports remain truthful.

Meta-reviewer: That's a good point. Review 2, on the other hand, is more critical of the paper, noting that the setting is rather strange and the analysis does not provide any interesting insights. Review 2 also criticizes the fact that the paper's mechanism simply stops if untruthfulness is detected. Do you have any comment on that criticism?

Dialogue agent: I understand the concern raised by Review 2 about the mechanism simply stopping if untruthfulness is detected. However, this is an intentional design choice to enforce Bayesian incentive compatibility and ensure truthful reporting. As for the criticism that the analysis does not provide any interesting insights, I think that our proposed mechanism is the first to achieve an approximate Bayesian incentive compatibility policy with sublinear regret in the online allocation setting where neither the valuation distributions nor payments/transfers can be used.

Meta-reviewer: That's fair. Review 3 seems to be more positive and praises the paper for addressing an interesting problem and proposing a simple and natural algorithm. However, Review 3 also notes a weakness in the paper's assumption that all players have the same valuation distribution. Do you have any comment on that?

Dialogue agent: Yes, our paper's mechanism crucially relies on the assumption that players have the same valuation distribution. We acknowledge that the case of heterogeneous players is much harder, as mentioned in our conclusion. However, we do believe that our proposed mechanism is significant progress towards addressing the problem of strategic online allocation with limited information.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on these reviews and your responses, it seems that the paper is technically solid and addresses an interesting problem, but has some limitations and weaknesses. However, I would like to ask about your confidence in your responses. How confident are you in your responses to the criticisms raised in the reviews?

Dialogue agent: I am fairly confident in my responses, but as with any scientific work, there could be some aspects that I did not fully understand or that could benefit from further investigation and analysis.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your honesty. Given the reviews and your responses, I will take some time to consider the merits of the paper and the criticisms raised.
