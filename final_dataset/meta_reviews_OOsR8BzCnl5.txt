Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent, for joining me today. I have read through the reviews for the paper "Trusted Multi-View Classification" and I have some questions for you. Can you give me some background on the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. The paper proposes a multi-view classification method that incorporates uncertainty estimation for reliable classification. The algorithm is based on Dempster-Shafer theory and uses Dirichlet distributions to define the weight of each view. The main contributions of the paper are the integration of evidence at a dynamic and learnable level, the use of subjective logic theory to model uncertainty, and the empirical evaluation showing effectiveness and reliability of the method.

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. I see that Review 1 gave a rating of 7 and expressed confidence in the evaluation, while Review 2 had several concerns about the paper's experimental results and related works and proposed a rejection with a rating of 4. Review 3 gave a rating of 8 and had minor comments. What is your opinion on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent and considering the reviews without any personal bias or opinion, I cannot provide a rating or recommendation on whether to accept or reject the paper. However, I can answer any specific questions you may have based on the paper and the reviews.

Meta-Reviewer: That's fair. I would like to ask about Review 2's concerns. They mentioned that the paper's experimental results were not sufficient and that the paper did not compare with some relevant baselines like Bayesian and deep CCA-based methods. Do you have any response to that?

Dialogue Agent: The paper did compare its proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods for multi-view classification in its empirical evaluation, as shown in Table 2. The choice of baselines was motivated by their relevance to the proposed method and previous literature. The paper also discussed the limitations of the method and potential future work, as any good paper should. Regarding Bayesian and deep CCA-based methods, the paper focused on the proposed method's unique contributions and did not intend to provide an exhaustive comparison with all other methods.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Review 2 also mentioned concerns about the noise in the experimental results and the use of Dirichlet distributions for each view. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: The paper did add Gaussian noise to half of the views and compared the performance of the proposed method with and without noise. The results showed that the proposed method was more robust to noise and had better performance with uncertainty estimation. As for using Dirichlet distributions, the paper used them as a way to define the weight of each view based on its strength. The choice of Dirichlet distributions was motivated by their applicability to multi-class classification and their use in previous literature. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses, dialogue agent. My final question is about the confidence levels in the reviews. Review 1 expressed a confidence level of 3 and Review 3 expressed a confidence level of 5. How important are these confidence levels for making a final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The confidence levels in the reviews can provide some guidance on the strength of the reviewers' evaluations, but they should not be the sole factor in making the final decision. The quality of the reviews and the content of the paper should also be taken into account, as well as any other concerns or feedback from other reviewers or experts in the field. Ultimately, the decision should be based on a thorough evaluation of the paper's contributions, limitations, and potential impact.
