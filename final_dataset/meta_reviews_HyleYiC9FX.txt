 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Text Embeddings for Retrieval from a Large Knowledge Base":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Text Embeddings for Retrieval from a Large Knowledge Base". Can you provide me with a summary of the paper and the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper proposes a retrieval model based on the residual network and evaluates the use of ELMo word embedding with/without IDF weight. The reviews suggest that the paper sets a strong baseline for the retrieving target paragraph for question answering on the SQuAD dataset, but the motivation for using the word embedding and contextual word embedding over the TF-IDF feature is not clear. Additionally, the choice of dataset and the lack of comparison with other retrieval-based QA systems are noted as limitations.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the strengths and limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper's strengths include setting a strong baseline for the retrieving target paragraph for question answering on the SQuAD dataset and the use of interesting points such as the use of word embedding itself as the feature representation. However, the limitations include the lack of clear motivation for using the word embedding and contextual word embedding over the TF-IDF feature, and the lack of comparison with other retrieval-based QA systems.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: What are the reviewer's confidence and rating for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the reviewer's confidence is 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. The rating is 3: Clear rejection.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you provide me with any suggestions for the authors?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the reviewers suggest that the authors should provide a clearer motivation for using the word embedding and contextual word embedding over the TF-IDF feature, and provide more comparison with other retrieval-based QA systems. Additionally, the reviewers note that the choice of dataset and the lack of consideration of TF-IDF/IDF and embedding for identifying the related document and resolving semantic ambiguity may be worth exploring.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and your summary, I will make my decision on the paper.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
