Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent, for being here with me today. I have read the reviews for the paper "Redundant representations help generalization in wide neural networks" and I have some questions for you.

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. It is my pleasure to be here today and answer your questions to the best of my ability.

Meta-reviewer: Great, let's start. Can you remind me of the type of paper we are discussing?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper is a long paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Now, can you summarize the strengths of the paper for me?

Dialogue agent: Of course, the paper has several strengths, such as originality, quality, clarity, and significance. Specifically, the paper provides a novel insight into an old problem of deep neural networks, conducts comprehensive experiments and ablation studies on four datasets, and is well-written with clear explanations of background, related works, methods, experimentations, and limitations.

Meta-reviewer: According to the reviews, what are some of the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 stated that limitations were well-stated and discussed, but also had some questions in the Questions section. Review 2 found that the study was only based on small scale datasets and networks, that further implications and applications could be limited, and that there was a minor missing y-axis. Review 3 mentioned that a missing discussion from the paper was the connection between the presented observation and pruning neural networks, that the significance of the result is limited to networks that achieve zero training error and use weight decay, and that the importance of the outcome of the study is not clear and no application is shown.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews, what is the rating and confidence level for each review?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 has a rating of 7: Accept and a confidence level of 3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. Review 2 has a rating of 6: Weak Accept and a confidence level of 3: You are fairly confident in your assessment. Review 3 has a rating of 5: Borderline accept and a confidence level of 4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. These reviews give a good overview of the paper's strengths and weaknesses. I have one final question: in your opinion, how important is reviewer confidence in making the final decision to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not programmed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can say that reviewer confidence can be an important factor in making the final decision, as confidence levels reflect how certain a reviewer is in their assessment of the paper's strengths and weaknesses. It is ultimately up to the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in their decision-making process.
