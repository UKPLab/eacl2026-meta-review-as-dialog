Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you summarize the main contributions of "On the symmetries of the synchronization problem in Cryo-EM: Multi-Frequency Vector Diffusion Maps on the Projective Plane"?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper proposes a method to improve the 3D reconstruction of cryo-EM generated 2D images. The authors extended the use of Multi-Frequency Vector Diffusion Maps (MFVDM) to estimate the absolute pose of individual 2D images, which can then be used to estimate the 3D density of the object, instead of 2D classification methods currently used. They discovered that relative poses between images in O(2), but not SO(2), provide sufficient constraints to identify image poses in SO(3). Finally, the authors validated their approach on two synthetic datasets.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Reviewer 1 mentioned that some details on the synthetic cryo-EM dataset generation and experiments are missing. Can you tell me more about the validation process?

Dialogue agent: I'm afraid I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but I can tell you that the paper validated the presented ideas on one synthetic and one experimental datasets, and showed accurate pose estimations. However, it is true that some details on the synthetic cryo-EM dataset generation and experiments are missing in the manuscript.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 2 noted that the formal description of the symmetries can be a strength and a weakness, depending on the reader's mathematical knowledge and that the absence of a proof-of-concept on real-world data is regrettable. Can you comment on these points?

Dialogue agent: Again, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that the paper establishes a formal description of the symmetries present in cryo-EM and proposes a method to enable the Vector Diffusion Map to recover particle poses using the insights from symmetries. Although the paper does not present a proof-of-concept on real-world data, the presented analysis of the synchronization symmetries could be helpful for any independent approach to improve 3D reconstruction in cryo-EM.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 3 pointed out that the presented work assumes viewing angles to be uniformly distributed, which is not true for real-world cryo-EM datasets, and that it would be helpful to see how the effectiveness of the presented approach deteriorates as the viewing angle distribution diverges from being uniformly distributed. Can you comment on this weakness?

Dialogue agent: The paper states that the presented work assumes uniform distribution of poses. However, the assumption does not hold true for real-world cryo-EM datasets. Hence, it would be illuminating to see how the effectiveness of the presented approach deteriorates as the viewing angle distribution is diverging from being uniformly distributed (and maybe getting closer and closer to the configuration commonly used in cryo-EM).
