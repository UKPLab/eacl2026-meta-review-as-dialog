Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have received three reviews for the paper titled "Progressive Weight Pruning Of Deep Neural Networks Using ADMM." Can you provide me with a summary of the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, meta-reviewer. Review 1 suggests that the experimental evidence is lacking and that the proposed method only works on small networks. The reviewer suggests comparing the proposed method with other methods with the same compression rates. Additionally, they suggest conducting more experiments to show the robustness of the choice of the penalty parameter across different experiments. Review 2 raises several concerns, including the benefit of ADMM for solving the sparse regularized NN optimization problem, the mask generation and its fit into the equations, and an unclear description of the hyper-parameters of the proposed method. The reviewer also questions the benefits of masked retraining and progressive pruning. Finally, Review 3 raises concerns over novelty, faster convergence, and the methodology regarding DP. The reviewer also raises questions regarding experimental performance and testing time.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. From these reviews, it seems that the paper has some significant issues. Could you provide me with more information on the confidence level of each review?

Dialogue agent: Yes, meta-reviewer. Review 1 has a confidence level of 3, meaning that the reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct. Review 2 has a confidence level of 4, meaning that the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that their evaluation is correct. Review 3 also has a confidence level of 4.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, I am concerned about the validity and novelty of the proposed methodology. Can you provide me with more information regarding the type of paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, meta-reviewer. The paper is classified as long.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews and the fact that the paper is long, I am still unsure whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you provide me with any information that could help me make a decision?

Dialogue agent: I am sorry, meta-reviewer, but as a dialogue agent, I am not able to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can provide you with any information that you may require to help you make a decision.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your assistance, dialogue agent. Can you provide me with any information on the confidence levels of the reviewers regarding their suggested actions?

Dialogue agent: Yes, meta-reviewer. Review 1 suggests that the paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 3. Review 2 also suggests that the paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 4. Finally, Review 3 suggests that the paper is only ok but not good enough to be accepted, with a confidence level of 4.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Based on this information, I believe that the novelty and validity of the proposed methodology are questionable. Furthermore, the confidence levels of the reviews suggest that the paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold. Therefore, I believe it would be in the best interest of the community to reject the paper. Thank you for your assistance, dialogue agent. 

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. Thank you for using me as a resource to decide on the acceptance of the paper.
