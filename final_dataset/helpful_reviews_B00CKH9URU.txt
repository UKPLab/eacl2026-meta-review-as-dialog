Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in the Max Steel Interactive Steel with Turbo Sword. Can you tell me more about it?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The Max Steel Interactive Steel with Turbo Sword is an interactive toy that makes sounds and lights up. The sword itself has 19 spoken phrases and sounds and neat lighting effects. It also comes with an alien interactive toy that makes the sword react differently when connected to the hilt of the sword.

Buyer: That sounds really cool! Is it durable?

Dialogue Agent: The sword is big and sturdy, and has motion sensors that produce a lot of noise. However, some customers have reported that the sword blade got bent side ways and didn't pop back out after a few weeks of use.

Buyer: Hmmm, that's concerning. Is it suitable for younger children?

Dialogue Agent: I would suggest this toy more for older kids as the younger ones love to hit people, things, and anything in reach. Although some customers have mentioned that their 4-year-old loves it and it's well made with good sounds.

Buyer: I see. What about the steel accessory? Is it easy to attach to the sword?

Dialogue Agent: I will admit that a younger child is going to need help to attach Max Steel to their shirt, but they will have loads of fun once he is there. The fact that there is a second part (Steel) adds to the fun and keeps him busy with it longer than just a sword. 

Buyer: Okay, thank you for the information. Can you tell me more about the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, there are mixed reviews. Some customers reported that the sword is exactly what they expected from watching the videos and that it's a great buy for Max Steel fans. Others reported that it's not very durable and some parts broke easily. There are also a few who think it's overpriced and that there should be an on/off switch for the sound.

Buyer: Hmm, I'm not sure whether to get it now. Can you make any recommendations?

Dialogue Agent: I'm sorry, I cannot give recommendations or opinions. I can only provide you with the information available. It's up to you to decide whether the Max Steel Interactive Steel with Turbo Sword is suitable for your needs.
