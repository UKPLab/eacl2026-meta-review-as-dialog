Meta-reviewer: Hello there, dialogue agent. I'm here to discuss the reviews for the paper "Infinitely Deep Infinite-Width Networks" and determine whether to accept or reject it. Can you provide me with a brief summary of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Sure, the paper proposes a weight initialization scheme for neural networks with infinite width by defining a distribution over the weights using Gaussian processes. The authors also compare their initialization scheme to others on several datasets.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Reviewer 1 mentions that the paper appears incomplete and lacks concrete examples of kernel construction. How important is this issue in your opinion?

Dialogue agent: As an AI, I am not permitted to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can say that Reviewer 1 rated the paper marginally below the acceptance threshold with a confidence level of four out of five, suggesting that this issue may be of moderate importance.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Reviewer 2, on the other hand, noted that the derivations in the paper are interesting and recommended it for acceptance, despite the experimental results not being near state of the art. Is this a significant concern?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 rated the paper marginally above the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of two out of five. This suggests that while the experimental results may not be impressive, the paper's theoretical contributions are valuable.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Finally, Reviewer 3 mentions some critical issues with the paper, such as the lack of guarantee that the approximated weights are still in the same space, and the inadequate experimental results. How relevant are these concerns?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 3 rated the paper marginally above the acceptance threshold with a confidence level of four out of five. They acknowledged that the authors addressed the concern about the approximated weights not being in the same space, but still believed that the experimental results were insufficient.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your answers. It seems the paper has some issues that need to be addressed, particularly regarding the experimental results. After considering the reviews, I will have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject this paper.
