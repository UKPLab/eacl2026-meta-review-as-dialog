Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "Universal Successor Features Approximators". The first review rates the paper as good and recommends acceptance while acknowledging some minor issues. The second review rates the paper marginally below the acceptance threshold, citing concerns about the size of the contribution and the complexity of the approach. The third review is more positive than the second, rating the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold. The reviewer commends the paper's careful explanation and clear results but wishes for a better understanding of the regularities exploited in the methods and results. They also raise some minor issues around notation and complexity analysis.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your summary of the reviews. Can you provide more information about the concerns raised in the second review about the size of the contribution and the complexity of the approach?

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, the reviewer raises concerns that the paper's contribution is only a small improvement over prior work in the field. They also highlight that the proposed approach increases the dimensionality of the Q* value, negating the potential advantages of other heuristics. Additionally, the reviewer feels that the density of presentation and statements regarding similarity to other works might limit the relevance of the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Understood. It seems that the concerns raised by the second reviewer should be taken into consideration when evaluating the paper. What about the third review that rates the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold?

Meta-Reviewer: The third review is more positive about the paper's contribution, acknowledging the significance of tackling the problem of generalizing to new tasks in reinforcement learning. They commend the paper's careful explanation and clear results and note that the authors have been diligent in explaining the regularities exploited by the proposed approach. However, the reviewer also wishes for a better understanding of the regularities exploited in the methods and results, and raises concerns around the lack of complexity analysis.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your insights. Based on these reviews, it seems that the paper has merit but could benefit from additional clarification around the regularities exploited and the computational complexity of the approach. The first and third reviews suggest that the paper should be accepted, while the second is more critical. Given this information, what is your opinion on whether to accept or reject the paper?

Meta-Reviewer: Ultimately, it is up to the decision of the editor based on the opinions expressed by the reviewers. But based on the reviews, the paper seems to have a decent contribution with some minor issues and concerns that could be addressed in a revision. I would lean towards acceptance but would recommend that the authors address the concerns raised by the reviewers in a revision.
