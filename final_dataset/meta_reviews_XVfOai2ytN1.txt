 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "On global convergence of ResNets: From finite to infinite width using linear parameterization":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "On global convergence of ResNets: From finite to infinite width using linear parameterization". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper studies the convergence of continuous-time residual networks with linear parameterization in the residual block, and derives a functional PL condition for the gradient of the loss function. The authors also propose two approaches to extend local convergence to global convergence.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the novel aspects of this work?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The paper presents a new analysis of the loss function of the model, which leads to local convergence. The novel parts of this work lie in the functional PL condition for the loss of the model, as well as the approaches to extend local convergence to global convergence in section 5.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper addresses the limitations by proving a functional PL condition for the gradient of the loss function, which leads to local convergence. However, the authors note that the global convergence of the model is left for future work.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I noticed that the paper violates the NeurIPS submission rules by including supplementary materials in the main paper submission. How do you evaluate the impact of this violation on the paper's assessment?

Dialogue Agent: I assess the impact of the violation as moderate. While the violation does not significantly affect the technical solidity of the paper, it does affect its evaluation and reproducibility.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on your assessment, I will give the paper a rating of 6: Weak Accept.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback. Based on your rating, I will provide the following summary: "The paper provides a new analysis of the loss function of ResNets with linear parameterization, leading to local convergence. The paper's novel contributions and approaches to extend local convergence to global convergence make it a technically solid paper with high impact. However, the violation of the NeurIPS submission rules and the lack of global convergence results may affect the paper's evaluation and reproducibility."
