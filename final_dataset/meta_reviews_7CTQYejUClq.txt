Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you provide me with a summary of the paper and its contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, the paper presents EAGER, a new system for Entity Resolution task that combines graph embeddings and attribute values. The paper also includes a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach and a discussion of the results. The main contribution of this paper is the combination of two approaches, graph embedding-based and attribute-based, to improve entity resolution performance.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you tell me about the evaluations done in this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the evaluation is well-conducted and compares EAGER with the relevant state-of-the-art methods on various datasets. The authors also mention the distinction between rich and shallow graphs in the evaluation process, which can help users select the appropriate method for their specific use case or dataset. However, reviewer two makes some suggestions about the evaluation protocol, such as using more realistic negative examples and testing it with large-scale knowledge graphs.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds good. What were the reviewers' ratings and confidence levels?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer one rated the paper with a 7, indicating that it is a good paper and should be accepted. The reviewer was fairly confident with the evaluation. Reviewer two gave a rating of 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 4. Reviewer three provided the highest rating of 8, which means the paper is in the top 50% of accepted papers and should be clearly accepted. The reviewer showed a fairly confident evaluation of the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. Considering the ratings and confidence levels from the reviewers, can you recommend accepting or rejecting this paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not authorized to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can provide you with the reviewers' feedback and their ratings for you to make a decision.
