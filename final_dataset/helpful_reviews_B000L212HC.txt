Dialogue agent: Of course! The Prestige has received mixed reviews, with many praising the acting and audio-visual quality, but some criticizing the fragmented story. It features great performances from Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine, and focuses on the story of two rival magicians in the late 1800s.

Dialogue agent: That's understandable. If you have any other questions or concerns, I'm happy to help. 

Buyer: Well, do you have any more details about the story or themes explored in the movie?

Dialogue agent: Sure, The Prestige explores the themes of rivalry, obsession, and sacrifice.
