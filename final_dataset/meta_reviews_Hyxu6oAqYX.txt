Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you please introduce yourself and provide an overview of the reviews for the paper titled "An Energy-Based Framework for Arbitrary Label Noise Correction"?

Dialogue Agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I am an AI dialogue agent, and I have access to the three reviews for the paper. The first review is generally positive, stating that the problem is well-motivated and the paper is well-written with good experimental results. However, the reviewer identifies areas where the paper could be improved, such as providing more analysis of the energy-based approach and testing the approach on more real-world problems. The second review also suggests improvements, such as providing more motivation for why the proposed method is effective and expanding the experiments to larger-scale datasets with realistic unknown noise. The third review raises concerns about the assumptions made in the paper and the lack of theoretical guarantees, as well as suggesting comparisons with recent related work.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the overview. Based on the reviews, what is the overall rating and confidence level for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The overall rating for the paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold, with a rating of 5 out of 10 in all three reviews. The confidence level for the first and second reviews are both 4, meaning the reviewers are confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. The confidence level for the third review is 5, meaning the reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you clarify some points from the first review? What is the amount of cleanly labeled data required for the proposed approach to work? Were the hyperparameters tuned using cross-validation?

Dialogue Agent: The first reviewer also had some minor clarification questions. Regarding the amount of cleanly labeled data required, the authors used a pre-selected percentage in their experiments, but it is non-trivial to establish that for different applications. The reviewer suggests it would be beneficial for the authors to clarify this point. Additionally, the reviewer asks if the hyperparameters were chosen from cross-validation or from the standard deviation of the energy terms in all experiment results. The paper does not provide clear information on this point.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Moving on to the second review, can you explain why the reviewer believes that the proposed method is not well-motivated, and why the experiments need to be expanded to larger-scale datasets?

Dialogue Agent: According to the second reviewer, the paper lacks motivation for why a contrastive objective or an energy-based autoencoder is a good solution for label correction. They argue that it is not clear how the discriminative features learned by an energy-based model are connected to the label correctness. The reviewer also believes that experiments on larger-scale datasets with realistic unknown noise are necessary to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. This would involve establishing state-of-the-art classification accuracy, which would serve as strong support for the paper.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Finally, can you elaborate on the concerns raised in the third review regarding the assumptions made in the paper and the lack of theoretical guarantees?

Dialogue Agent: The third reviewer raises concerns about the assumptions made in the paper, such as assuming that label noise strongly depends on discriminative features. They argue that this assumption may be strong, as most labels are provided according to the original instance features. Additionally, the reviewer believes that the theory behind why the residual energy can be used to identify label noise is elusive. They suggest that the paper could benefit from comparisons with recent related work, such as a paper proposing algorithms to identify label noise with theoretical guarantees. Finally, the reviewer criticizes the paper for having hyperparameters that are empirically set, which is not convincing. They also suggest that it would be interesting to see how corrected labels will recursively help better learn the discriminative features, with the help of illustrating figures.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your insights, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, I have a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. I will take into account the reviewers' feedback and decide whether to accept or reject the paper.
