Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "Asynchronous SGD without gradient delay for efficient distributed training", and I have some questions before making a decision. What type of paper is this again?

Dialogue agent: This is a long paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Review 1 mentions that the paper presents the main contribution clearly, but it also suggests that the algorithm proposed is not significant enough. What can you tell me about this?

Dialogue agent: I cannot provide an opinion on the algorithm's significance, but Review 1 mentions that there are not enough comparisons between the proposed algorithm and other variants of delayed gradient conditions.

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 states that the paper does not solve the fundamental issue of staleness in asynchronous SGD and proposes just one implementation rather than a new algorithm. It also mentions that there are not enough comparisons to other implementations. Can you confirm this?

Dialogue agent: I can confirm that Review 2 mentions these concerns, and it suggests that the theoretical analysis is not brand new as well.

Meta-reviewer: Okay. And what about Review 3? It says that the paper is hard to follow and the experiments are not strong enough.

Dialogue agent: I can confirm that Review 3 mentions these issues as well as concerns about some details in the algorithm description and experimental settings.

Meta-reviewer: So, based on these reviews, what is your recommendation for this paper?

Dialogue agent: I cannot provide a recommendation, but I can tell you that Review 2 and 3 suggest rejection, while Review 1 suggests that the paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And how confident are the reviewers in their evaluations?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 has a confidence of 4, and Review 2 and 3 have confidences of 4 and 5, respectively.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, I think I will reject the paper. Although Review 1 suggests it is marginally below acceptance, Reviews 2 and 3 raise significant concerns. Additionally, Review 2 has a high level of confidence, indicating a strong evaluation.
