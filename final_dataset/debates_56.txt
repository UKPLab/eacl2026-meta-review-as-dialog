Decision Maker: Hi, I'm trying to understand the arguments for and against the motion that we should stop welcoming undocumented immigrants. Can you explain the reasoning behind each side?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. The arguments in favor of stopping the welcoming of undocumented immigrants are based on two principles: respect for the rule of law and respect for facts on the ground. The idea is that allowing illegal immigrants to enter the country without legal documentation violates our immigration laws and gives non-Americans the power to determine our immigration policy.

On the other hand, those who oppose the motion argue that immigrants have made the United States a prosperous, dynamic, and free country. Low-skilled immigrants, in particular, are benefiting the United States economically and socially. Moreover, they believe that the law must be consistent with how normal people live their lives, and our current immigration laws do not reflect our needs as an economy and our highest values.

Decision Maker: So, what are the consequences of continuing to welcome undocumented immigrants?

Dialogue Agent: According to the arguments in favor of the motion, there will be social problems for years to come if we don't figure out how to prevent underclass culture amongst the children of illegal immigrants from developing. Additionally, there will be rising welfare and crime rates if we maintain the current high levels of illegal entry. 

However, those against the motion do not believe that there are negative consequences of welcoming undocumented immigrants. They believe that legalizing their status would only benefit our economy and society.

Decision Maker: But what about the argument that illegal immigrants are taking advantage of taxpayer benefits without contributing to society?

Dialogue Agent: While there may be some undocumented immigrants who take advantage of taxpayer benefits, the other side argues that this is not representative of all immigrants. Many undocumented immigrants work hard, contribute to society, and are seeking a better life for themselves and their families. Legalizing their status would only benefit our economy and society.

Decision Maker: Okay, but what about the argument that we need to enforce the rule of law?

Dialogue Agent: Those against the motion do not believe that we should stop enforcing the law. They argue that we should change our immigration laws to better reflect our needs as an economy, our need for a more secure nation, and our highest values. In contrast, those in favor of the motion argue that allowing undocumented immigrants to enter the country illegally undermines the rule of law.

Decision Maker: Thank you for explaining the arguments. It's a tough decision to make, but after listening to both sides, I think I'm leaning towards voting against the motion.
