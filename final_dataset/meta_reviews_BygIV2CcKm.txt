 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Learning to Augment Influential Data":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Learning to Augment Influential Data". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a differentiable framework for learning to augment data for image classification. It uses a spatial transformer and GANs as parametric data augmenters, and formulates the validation set loss with respect to the data augmenter in a differentiable manner.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the pros and cons of the proposed method?

Dialogue Agent: The proposed method has several pros, including the fact that it does not require many trials of model training under different training data, and it learns the data augmentation directly using the final classification objective. Additionally, the paper extends the differentiable form of influence function across the training and validation set and then across the original and augmented data, which is an inspiring extension of the recent related advances.

However, the paper also has some cons, such as the fact that the experimental results on MNIST (with less labeled data) and Cifar-10 are not as strong as those of Ratner et al., and the proposed method requires a parametric model (e.g, STN, GAN) which can be challenging to design.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you elaborate on the reviewers' comments?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. Reviewer 1 found the paper to be valuable and publishable, but had some questions about the clarity of the paper and a few errors. Reviewer 2 found the paper to be marginally above the acceptance threshold, but had some concerns about the experimental results and the fact that the proposed method requires a parametric model. Reviewer 3 found the paper to be ambitious, but had concerns about the generalization of the proposed method and the experimental results.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the reviews, how would you rate the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 4.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. I will consider the reviews and your summary when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
