Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have read all three reviews for the paper "Integrating linguistic knowledge into DNNs: Application to online grooming detection". I would like to start by asking the dialogue agent if they could provide some context on the type of paper and reviews that were provided?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper is a long paper proposing a new approach for integrating linguistic knowledge into neural networks for the purpose of online grooming detection. The reviews are mixed, with one reviewer giving a marginally below acceptance threshold rating, one giving a marginally above acceptance threshold rating, and the third reviewer suggesting rejection.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Could you provide any additional information on the proposed approach and the experimental results?

Dialogue Agent: Yes. The proposed approach integrates priors into a DNN in the form of Linguistic sub-models that capture characteristics of online grooming. The authors use the PAN-12 dataset for sexual predators to demonstrate the impact of these augmentations on performance of classification. The authors perform a solid amount of experiments to assess the differences between their suggested methods and baseline models. In the experimental evaluation, linguistic knowledge is injected within two base models, namely one based on LSTMs, and the other one on XL-Net. Performance is shown to be improved with respect to the state-of-the-art.

Meta-Reviewer: Reviewers 1 and 2 both raise issues with the specificity of the task and the experimental methodology. How do these concerns weigh in the overall assessment of the paper's contribution?

Dialogue Agent: The concerns raised by reviewers 1 and 2 are valid and should be considered by the meta-reviewer in their decision. Reviewer 1 raises a question about the interpretability of the proposed approach when compared to a DNN that is trained without explicit sub-models, while reviewer 2 questions the generality of the proposed methodology when applied to other scenarios. While the experimental results show an improvement in performance, it is important to take into account these concerns about the specificity of the task and the generalizability of the proposed approach.

Meta-Reviewer: That is a valid point. Reviewer 3 also raises concerns with the clarity of the paper and the conceptual gaps in the research. How important are these concerns in the overall assessment?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3 raises valid points about the clarity of the paper, the conceptual gaps, and the lack of ethical considerations. These concerns are important for the meta-reviewer to take into account when making their decision. The meta-reviewer may also want to consider the suggestions made by Reviewer 3 to improve the clarity of the paper and to address the issues raised.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. One final question, how important is reviewer confidence in the meta-reviewer's decision-making process?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer confidence is an important factor to consider, but the meta-reviewer should also take into account the validity of the concerns raised by the reviewers. While a highly confident rating may carry more weight, the meta-reviewer should base their decision on a careful consideration of all the reviews and the quality of the research presented in the paper.
