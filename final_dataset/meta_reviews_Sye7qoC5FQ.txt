Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper titled "Adversarial Attacks on Node Embeddings" and I am trying to decide whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you tell me more about the paper type and the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Yes, this paper is categorized as "long" and the reviews provided cover several aspects of the paper such as the paper's significance, the approach used, and the experimental results presented.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 suggests that the paper should include more experiments on various random graph models to understand the susceptibility of node embeddings to attacks. How important is this recommendation?

Dialogue agent: The recommendation is relevant and the paper could benefit from additional experiments on various random graph models to understand the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 points out some issues with the analysis method and the algorithm proposed in the paper. How significant are these issues?

Dialogue agent: These issues are important because they impact the effectiveness of the proposed approach and could potentially limit its practical usefulness.

Meta-reviewer: Finally, Review 3 highlights some positive aspects of the paper such as detailed proofs presented in the appendix and effective experiments. However, it also raises concerns about the efficiency of the proposed approach and the selection of candidate flip edges. How do you view these concerns?

Dialogue agent: The concerns regarding the efficiency of the proposed approach and the selection of candidate flip edges are important and could potentially impact the practical feasibility of the approach. 

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews and your responses, it seems that the paper has some significant issues that need to be addressed. However, the reviews also suggest that the paper has potential and could be improved. Given this, I think it would be appropriate to request a revision from the authors.
