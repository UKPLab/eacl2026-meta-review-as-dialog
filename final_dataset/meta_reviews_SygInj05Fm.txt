 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hi there, I'm reviewing a paper and I'd like your help in assessing its acceptability. Can you tell me about the paper's title and type?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper's title is "Physiological Signal Embeddings (PHASE) via Interpretable Stacked Models." It's a long paper.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: Great, thank you. I've read the reviews, and I have some questions about the paper's claims and methodology. Can you help me understand the paper's contributions and potential impact?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The authors claim contributions in three areas: learning representations on physiological signals, using the hidden state of LSTMs as a representation of the inputs signals, and proposing a way to estimate interpretability using Shapley values.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. However, I have some concerns about the paper's transferability and interpretability. The reviews mention that the authors claim PHASE learns transferable embeddings, but the gap between the performance of the proposed method and existing methods is not significant. Additionally, the interpretability of the model is weak, and the authors could have provided more details on the data used and the experimental setup.

Dialogue Agent: I see. The authors do address these concerns in their paper, but I understand your reservations. The authors claim that PHASE learns transferable embeddings by training the LSTMs to predict the minimum value of the signal in the fixed future time window. However, the reviews point out that the authors' design of the embedding learning process with a priori knowledge of the downstream tasks weakens their claim of transferability. Additionally, the interpretability of the model is a concern, as the authors do not provide enough details on the structure of the model that generates Shapley values.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the concerns. Based on the reviews and your summary, I think the paper has some potential but needs more work to address the concerns. What is your assessment of the paper's acceptability?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the concerns you've mentioned, I would assess the paper as marginally below acceptance threshold. The authors make some interesting contributions, but the paper needs more work to address the concerns and strengthen the claims.

Turn 5:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your assessment. I think I'll need to carefully consider the paper's potential and the authors' responses to the concerns before making a final decision.

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I'm here to help if you have any further questions or need any additional information.
