 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Multi-objective training of Generative Adversarial Networks with multiple discriminators":

Turn 1:
Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm evaluating a paper titled "Multi-objective training of Generative Adversarial Networks with multiple discriminators". Can you provide a summary of the paper's contributions and significance?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper offers two main contributions: a new perspective on multiple-discriminator GAN training by framing it in the context of multi-objective optimization, and a new method for training multiple-discriminator GANs called Hypervolume Maximization. The proposed method weighs the gradient contributions of each discriminator by its loss. The paper also compares the proposed method with previous approaches and shows its performance through experiments.

Turn 2:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. I have some concerns about the paper's significance and the comparison with previous work. Can you address these points?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper acknowledges that the idea of training GANs with multiple discriminators has been explored in previous work, but argues that the proposed method offers a new perspective by framing it in the context of multi-objective optimization. The authors also compare the proposed method with previous approaches and show its performance through experiments.

Turn 3:
Meta-reviewer: I see. I'm still not convinced about the paper's significance. Can you tell me more about the computational cost of the proposed method and how it compares with previous approaches?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The authors claim that the proposed method is more computationally efficient than previous approaches, as it does not require the computation of gradients for all discriminators. However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the computational cost of the proposed method with previous approaches.

Turn 4:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I think the paper has some strengths, such as providing a new perspective on multiple-discriminator GAN training and offering a new method for training multiple-discriminator GANs. However, I have some concerns about the paper's significance and the comparison with previous work. What is your assessment of the paper's overall quality and its potential impact on the field?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper has some strengths, such as providing a new perspective on multiple-discriminator GAN training and offering a new method for training multiple-discriminator GANs. However, the paper's significance and comparison with previous work are subject to debate. Overall, I would assess the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 4.
