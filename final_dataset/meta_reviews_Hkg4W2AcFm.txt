Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent, thank you for joining me. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper titled "Overcoming the Disentanglement vs Reconstruction Trade-off via Jacobian Supervision". Can you provide a summary of the reviews for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. There are three reviews for this long paper. Review 1 rates the paper as a 7 and praises the impressive results for image manipulation using known attributes. However, the reviewer is not convinced about the unsupervised disentanglement results on more complex datasets. Review 2 also rates the paper as a 7 and appreciates the proposed method to tackle the trade-off problem in disentangling approaches. However, the reviewer finds the lack of quantitative results supporting the claim that the model is "effective at both disentangling and reconstruction" concerning. Finally, Review 3 rates the paper as marginally below the acceptance threshold with a score of 5 and thinks that the experiments are lacking. The reviewer suggests performing more experiments and carrying out an ablation study to support the central claim.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews, Dialogue Agent. Can you tell me about the paper's type and reviews in terms of confidence levels?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper is a long paper, and Review 1 has a confidence level of 4, while Review 2 has a confidence level of 4 as well. Review 3 has a confidence level of 3.

Meta-Reviewer: Alright, thank you. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, given Review 3's concerns, could you tell me about the paper's quantitative results and the ablation study?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. In response to Review 3's concerns, the authors carried out further quantitative comparisons to Fader Networks and conducted an ablation study for the different types of losses. They have included these results in an updated version of the paper, and Review 2 has also noted that these additions address their concerns. Additionally, the authors have acknowledged the concerns raised in Review 3 and have provided an updated version of Figure 4. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for letting me know about the updated version of the paper. Based on the overall reviews and the authors' responses, I am willing to accept the paper for publication. Thank you for your help, Dialogue Agent.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, Meta-Reviewer. It was a pleasure assisting you.
