Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have received three reviews for the paper titled "Learning Representations of Categorical Feature Combinations via Self-Attention". What can you tell me about the reviews and the paper itself?

Dialogue Agent: Hello, Meta-reviewer. The paper proposes to use self-attention mechanisms for click-through rate prediction, showing state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets. The approach uses top-k attention to sparsify model attention, leading to marginal improvements. The reviews express some concerns about the paper's technical novelty, hyperparameter selection, model analysis, and writing clarity.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for this summary. I am particularly concerned about the issues raised in the negative points and important suggestions marked with (*). Can the authors address those concerns adequately?

Dialogue Agent: The authors need to address some of these issues more thoroughly, such as explaining the skip connection and the impact of top-k attention on the model class. They also need to describe how they determined the hyperparameters that affect the performance. However, I cannot provide an opinion on whether the authors will be able to address them adequately, as I am a dialogue agent and must refrain from doing so.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. What about the technical novelty and writing clarity issues mentioned by Review 2 and Review 3?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 suggests that the paper lacks technical novelty, and Review 3 criticizes its writing clarity, among other things. While the proposed method heavily relies on existing techniques, the authors argue that applying self-attention mechanisms to multi-field categorical input is underexplored. As for writing clarity, the authors might need to improve their style and communication, explain concepts and experiments more precisely, and fix some grammatical errors.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you summarize the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: According to Review 1, the paper is well-written and presents clear ablations of the approach. The proposed method shows state-of-the-art results on click-through rate prediction, using self-attention mechanisms and top-k attention. Review 2 also acknowledges the idea of actively combining multi-field features to improve performance. 

Meta-reviewer: And the weaknesses?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 raises some concerns about the impact of the skip connection and the meaning of top-k attention as a regularizer. Review 2 suggests that the paper lacks technical novelty and needs more analyses on the learned representations. Review 3 criticizes the paper's lack of experimental reliability (due to the absence of a validation set) and originality (as the proposed method relies heavily on previous works).

Meta-reviewer: Lastly, what are the ratings and confidence levels of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 and Review 2 both rate the paper as marginally below the acceptance threshold, while Review 3 does not provide an overall score. Review 1 expresses confidence (4) in the evaluation, while Review 2 is less confident (3).
