Meta-reviewer: Thank you both for your thorough reviews of this paper on Co-Mixup. Review 1 raises some important questions about the paper's methodology and implementation. Review 2 finds the paper to be a good one with convincing experimental results. Review 3 also finds the paper to be interesting, but raises concerns about the paper's clarity and thoroughness of experiments. 

In terms of the methodology, Review 1 asks about how the labels of the mixup examples are determined and whether they become multi-label examples. They also ask about the computational cost induced by the additional process required to produce saliency information and compatibility information. Review 1 also questions the degree to which the \omega value affects the proposed approach's performance and seeks clarification on the quality of the approximation provided in Section 4.2. They also ask about the paper's comparison to other regularization-based methods. 

In terms of experimentation, Review 1 raises concerns about the differences in performance between Co-Mixup and Puzzle Mix in Table 1. Review 3 also feels that the experiments could be more thorough and suggests comparing Co-Mixup to non-mixup baselines and conducting a more thorough ablation study. 

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your comments. I am not able to provide opinions or recommendations, but I can provide information to help address your concerns. 

Regarding the label determination, the details are explained in Section 3.2 of the paper, and mixup examples do not become multi-label examples. The additional process required to produce saliency information and compatibility information is a concern raised in Review 1. This is addressed in Section 3.1, where it is explained that the proposed method's computational cost is not significantly higher than that of other mixup methods. 

The degree to which the \omega value affects the proposed approach's performance is discussed in Section 3.3. In terms of the approximation provided in Section 4.2, it is explained that the approximation quality can be improved by iteratively improving the solution with the current selection of mixup data. Regarding the comparison to other regularization-based methods, the paper's focus is on mixup methods, but such comparisons could be explored in future work. 

In terms of the experiments, the differences in performance between Co-Mixup and Puzzle Mix in Table 1 are statistically significant, as mentioned in Section 4.1. Regarding the suggestion to compare to non-mixup baselines and conduct a more thorough ablation study, these are valuable suggestions that could be explored in future work. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. I appreciate the information provided. Based on the reviews and your responses, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I do have concerns about the clarity and thoroughness of the experiments raised in Review 3. Can you provide any additional information to address those concerns? 

Dialogue Agent: The concerns raised by Review 3 are valid and could be addressed in future work. However, the current paper does provide a thorough evaluation of Co-Mixup's performance on several tasks and outperforms mixup baselines. The paper also discusses the research's limitations and possibilities for future work. In light of that, I hope the paper can be accepted.
