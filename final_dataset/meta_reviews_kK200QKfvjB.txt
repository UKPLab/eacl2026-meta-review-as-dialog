 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Feature Learning in $L_2$-regularized DNNs: Attraction/Repulsion and Sparsity":

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm evaluating a paper titled "Feature Learning in $L_2$-regularized DNNs: Attraction/Repulsion and Sparsity". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper studies the $L_2$-regularized deep neural network (DNN) training and presents two reformulations of the optimization problem. The first reformulation expresses the network weights in terms of the preactivations via an orthogonal projection trick, while the second reformulation builds upon the first one and replaces the preactivations with the corresponding covariance matrices.

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the paper has two novel reformulations of the loss of $L_2$-regularized DNNs, which may be helpful for our understanding of DNNs. The second reformulation has some implications for the sparsity of the local minimum of homogeneous DNNs. Additionally, the paper provides a technical solid paper with high impact on at least one sub-area, or moderate-to-high impact on more than one areas, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the first reformulation and its connection to attraction/repulsion?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The first reformulation expresses the network weights in terms of the preactivations via an orthogonal projection trick. This allows for an insightful understanding of the features learned at optimality, in terms of attraction and repulsion. The authors discuss the fact that the reformulated optimization problems are not computationally useful, given the undesirable scaling with the number of data samples relative to training the network weights. However, the reformulations provide an interesting framework for understanding global minimizers of the deep network training cost.

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. What about the second reformulation and its connection to sparsity?

Dialogue Agent: The second reformulation builds upon the first one and replaces the preactivations with the corresponding covariance matrices. This provides a mechanism for learning the sparsity effect of the $L_2$ regularization in training of DNN with homogeneous non-linearities. The paper shows that the loss can be further reformulated in terms of the covariances of the hidden representations, which take the form of a partially convex optimization over a convex cone.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Are there any weaknesses or limitations mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the reviews mention that the paper has limited evaluation and the authors focus on tools that apply to deep networks, which is important, but the analysis is focused on understanding learned features in the network, but it does not involve any specific structural assumptions on $Y$ and $X$. Additionally, the paper assumes the minima can be achieved and perfect interpolation of the dataset, which may be a limitation.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and our conversation, I will make my final decision.
