Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper "SAPD+: An Accelerated Stochastic Method for Nonconvex-Concave Minimax Problems." Can you provide me with an overview of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. We have three reviews, and they are generally positive about the paper's technical solidity. Review 1 praises the proposed algorithm's new SOTA complexity and simplicity but critiques the messy proof and many notations. Review 2 acknowledges that the paper is well-written and easy to follow, but expresses concern about the originality of the paper. Finally, Review 3 compliments the paper's significance and the clear organization in terms of motivation, problem formulation, and literature review.

Meta-Reviewer: Based on these reviews, what is your recommendation regarding whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Unfortunately, as a dialogue agent, I am not authorized to give opinions or recommendations. However, I can answer any specific questions you might have about the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay. Review 1 mentioned that the proof was messy. Could you elaborate on this?

Dialogue Agent: According to Review 1, the proof contains many notations, and it was difficult to follow in some parts. However, it also acknowledged that this may be unavoidable in a paper of this type.

Meta-Reviewer: Interesting. Review 2 expressed concerns about the paper's originality. Could you explain this further?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 notes that the proposed algorithm is a natural stochastic version of the APD algorithm proposed in a previous paper, which was not cited in the main text. Additionally, the paper under review has a lot of overlap with an earlier paper that analyzed the SAPD+ algorithm for strongly convex-strongly concave problems. As a result, Review 2 questions the significance of the paper's results.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the explanation. Review 3 asserted that the paper has significance. How does the paper's contribution compare to existing research?

Dialogue Agent: According to Review 3, the paper's relaxing of the commonly adopted assumption that both the primal and dual domain should be compact is a significant improvement compared with existing works. Additionally, the algorithm proposed in the paper is new and technically sound. Overall, Review 3 asserts that the results are theoretically supported and will be of practical relevance given the prevalence of high-dimensional datasets in modern computing.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses, Dialogue Agent. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I am concerned about the varying levels of confidence in the reviewers' assessments. Review 1 is moderately confident, Review 2 is minimally confident, and Review 3 is moderately confident. How important is reviewer confidence in making a decision?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer confidence is an important factor in decision-making, but ultimately, it is up to the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of the reviewers' assessments. Confidence levels can be influenced by the reviewers' expertise in the area of the paper or their understanding of the submission, among other factors. It is important for the meta-reviewer to consider these factors when making their decision.
