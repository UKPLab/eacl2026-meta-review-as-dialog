 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Contextual Recurrent Convolutional Model for Robust Visual Learning":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Contextual Recurrent Convolutional Model for Robust Visual Learning". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper introduces a feedback connection to enhance feature learning through incorporating context information. The novelty of this work is weakened by the similarity to related works, and the authors need to provide more discussion on the difference from existing works.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. What are the reviewer's confidence and rating for this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the reviewer confidence is 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct, and the rating is 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you summarize the main points of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Review 1 highlights the lack of novelty and significance in the paper, and suggests that the authors need to provide more discussion on the difference from existing works. Review 2 notes that the paper lacks solid experiments and that the improvements are relatively modest. Review 3 expresses concerns about the experimental validation and suggests that the authors need to address these concerns before the paper can be accepted.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the reviews, I think the paper needs more work before it can be accepted. Can you provide any additional insights or comments?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper could benefit from more discussion on the difference from existing works, and the experimental validation could be strengthened by addressing the concerns raised in the reviews. Additionally, the authors may want to consider toning down some of the claims and providing more detailed explanations of the proposed method.
