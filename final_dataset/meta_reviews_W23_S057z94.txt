Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today. I've received three review for the paper "Conditional Independence Testing with Heteroskedastic Data and Applications to Causal Discovery". Can you give me a summary of the key points of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, the paper proposes a method for testing conditional independence in the presence of heteroskedasticity, with applications to causal discovery. Reviewers 1 and 3 both find the proposed method technically solid and appreciate the theoretical contributions of the paper. Reviewer 1 does note that the method requires expert knowledge about the source of heteroskedasticity, and Reviewer 3 requests more discussion about the re-weighting strategy used. Reviewer 2 also finds the paper technically solid, with high impact on at least one sub-area and good evaluation and resources.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. What is the confidence level of the reviewers in their assessment?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 has a confidence level of 3, indicating they are fairly confident in their assessment, but may have missed some details. Reviewers 2 and 3 have a confidence level of 4, indicating they are confident in their assessment, but may have missed some details.

Meta-reviewer: Based on your understanding of the reviewers' comments, what is your opinion on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, it is not my place to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can say that the paper has received positive reviews and is considered to be technically solid with moderate-to-high impact. The reviewers do note some limitations, such as the requirement for expert knowledge and possible improvements for the re-weighting strategy.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. I appreciate your help in summarizing the reviews and staying neutral in your response. Based on the reviewers' feedback, I think the paper is worth accepting with minor revisions. Thank you again for your assistance.
