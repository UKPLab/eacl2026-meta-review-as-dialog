Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the reviews. Based on what you've said, it seems like the paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of knowledge graph-to-text generation. Review 1 mentions that the dataset, EventNarrative, is 6 times larger than the current largest parallel dataset, and Review 2 notes that the authors have created the dataset based on well-established data sources, such as EventKG, Wikidata, and Wikipedia. 

Dialogue Agent: That is correct, the authors have provided a very detailed account of the data creation process, which includes entity matching and Narrative graph generation. Additionally, they have conducted a comprehensive qualitative evaluation as well as benchmark evaluations and baseline results. 

Meta-reviewer: That's great. Review 3 mentioned some concerns regarding the limitations of the dataset creation process and the quality of the dataset. Can you provide any more information about this? 

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 3 mentioned that the text became more artificial by replacing all entities with their canonical strings from the graph, which can lead to unnatural text. However, the authors have discussed these limitations and based on a human evaluation, found that these errors are rare. Furthermore, the authors have highlighted some limitations in the dataset creation process, such as missing entities due to the incompleteness of Wikidata and poor performance of co-reference resolution systems in event-centric data. They have also highlighted the need for further evaluations during the creation process. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 1 also mentioned some limitations in section 2.4, such as the possibility of double counting of certain events or properties if only an exact match is being considered. Is there any comment you can make on this limitation?

Dialogue Agent: While it is true that exact matching can lead to some limitations, the authors have employed various filtering methods to ensure a close correspondence between the text and the KG. Moreover, the KG-to-text matching algorithm that the authors have proposed is designed to automatically pair KGs to natural language texts, which has resulted in high accuracy values for entities and relations. 

Meta-reviewer: Thanks for clarifying that. Based on the reviews, I believe the paper makes a worthwhile contribution to the field and has addressed the concerns raised by the reviewers adequately. I would therefore give a rating of 7: Good paper and accept the paper. However, I would also like to take into account the confidence levels of the reviewers. Review 1 seems confident but not absolutely certain, and Review 2 is fairly confident in their evaluation. Review 3 is absolutely certain, but also notes some weaknesses. How would you suggest we weigh the confidence levels of these reviewers in making a final decision?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide any opinion or recommendation on this matter since it goes beyond the scope of my task, which is to provide information based on the reviews and the content of the paper. Ultimately, it is up to the meta-reviewer to decide on the relative confidence levels of the reviewers and weigh them in making the final decision.
