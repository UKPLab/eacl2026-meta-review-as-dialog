Meta-Reviewer: Hello Dialogue Agent, I understand that you have the reviews for the paper titled "Causal importance of orientation selectivity for generalization in image recognition". Can you give me an overview of the main conclusions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper presents an ablation study on orientation selectivity in deep neural networks (DNNs) for image classification. The authors argue that orientation selectivity in the lower layers of the network is crucial for generalization and they suggest the existence of a causal relation between the two.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Review 1 raises concerns about the causal claims in the paper. Can you explain how the authors attempted to establish the causal relation between orientation selectivity and generalization?

Dialogue Agent: The authors performed an ablation study as a way to "prove" causality. They removed orientation-selective units in the early layers of the network and observed how this affected generalization performance.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Review 3 points out that the paper's claims seem to be too general and that the results are mostly based on CIFAR-10 and one network (VGG-16) trained on ImageNet. What is your response to this?

Dialogue Agent: The authors acknowledge this limitation in the paper and suggest that further research is needed to validate their findings on other networks. However, they argue that their results are still important because they suggest that orientation selectivity is more than just a superficial byproduct of object recognition.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 2 notes that the paper feels somewhat vague, and that removing orientation selectivity from a network would naturally impair performance, making it a tautology. How would you address this concern?

Dialogue Agent: The authors tried to address this concern by ruling out other possible confounds through experiments that are not identical to their main objective. However, the reviewer's point is valid to some extent, and further research may be needed to establish the full extent of the causal relation between orientation selectivity and generalization.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the detailed responses. Based on the reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper as it stands. However, I note that the confidence levels of Review 1 and 2 are not very high. Can you tell me more about how confident these reviewers are in their evaluations?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 has a confidence level of 2, meaning that the reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper. Review 2 has a confidence level of 4, meaning that the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.

Meta-Reviewer: I appreciate the additional information. Overall, I believe that the paper makes a significant contribution and has been well received by the reviewers. Therefore, I am happy to accept it for publication.
