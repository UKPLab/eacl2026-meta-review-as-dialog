Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I'm reviewing the paper "An Extensible Benchmark Suite for Learning to Simulate Physical Systems" and I have a few questions about the reviews. Can you tell me more about the paper's contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, the paper focuses on providing a comprehensive benchmark suite for evaluating machine learning algorithms for simulation problems in physical systems. It presents four representative benchmark systems, explores the trade-offs between derivative-based prediction and step prediction, and advocates for the usage of K-nearest-neighbors to better understand the complexity of different simulation tasks. It also introduces baseline data-driven methods and the flexibility of its framework allows for the integration of other learning tasks or machine learning methods.

Meta-Reviewer: Thanks, that's helpful. Reviewer 1 discussed the confusion caused by repeated colors in figures 3 and 4. Do you have any insight into that?

Dialogue Agent: I'm aware of this issue, and I believe same-color marks are different architectures of the baseline methods. However, I can't provide any opinion or recommendation on whether readers would benefit from having more fine-grained labels for the methods (e.g. shallow vs deep MLP/CNN) in the figures. Furthermore, the paper doesn't indicate that the results are presented as averages over multiple runs, so it is unclear whether they were.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Reviewer 2 mentioned that the paper lacked a simpler differential system with a well-known closed-form solution as an interesting option as a baseline and recommended including timing analysis that was missing. Can you provide any context about these points?

Dialogue Agent: While I cannot offer any opinion or recommendation on which specific differential system to include, I can provide insight into the paper's experiments. The authors focused on presenting a suite of simple, representative physics problems as benchmarks, including ones that address the narrow and wide data regimes. They also provide reference numerical solutions for traditional time integration schemes to benchmark data-driven methods (MLPS, CNNs, kernel machines, Nearest neighbors). As for timing analysis, the paper does not include it, and I cannot provide any insights into this omission.

Meta-Reviewer: Thanks for your responses. Reviewer 3 felt that the contributions were not well-explained, and that the presented data was not novel or original. What does the paper offer in terms of comparison and analysis of state-of-the-art methods?

Dialogue Agent: The paper includes comparisons and analysis of baseline data-driven methods - namely KNN, neural networks, and convolutional neural networks - against reference numerical solutions for traditional time integration schemes. While the authors do not present analyses of state-of-the-art methods, they present these results as a step towards a unified evaluation protocol and metrics, which could have an impact on the future of related fields. The paper provides detailed descriptions of the generation methods, documents, and experiments, and takes a step towards providing a well-organized benchmark for learning physical systems.
