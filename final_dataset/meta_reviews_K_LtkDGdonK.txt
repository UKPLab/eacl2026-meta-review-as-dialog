Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Can you provide me with a summary of the paper's reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, Meta-Reviewer. Review 1 highlights the strength of the paper's experimental design and discussion, as well as the clear and easy-to-read statement. On the other hand, the lack of originality and failure to discuss limitations and potential negative societal impact are raised as weaknesses. Review 2 recognizes the significant contribution of the paper's multi-agent actor-critic framework, with clear empirical results and well-written paper. However, the ambiguous "squeezing" process, unfair comparison, and limited discussion of the algorithm's limitations are mentioned as weaknesses. Review 3 emphasizes the importance of the paper's asynchronous learning approach and well-organized motivation and experiments. While the limitations of the methodology are discussed, limited novelty is also raised as a weakness.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the synopsis. What is the type and title of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper is a long manuscript titled "Asynchronous Actor-Critic for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning."

Meta-Reviewer: Excellent. Now, what is your confidence in the reviewers' assessments?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 is rated as having a confidence of 5, indicating absolute certainty in their assessment. Reviewer 2 has a confidence rating of 4, indicating strong confidence, but not absolute certainty. Finally, Reviewer 3 is assessed with a confidence rating of 3, indicating fair confidence.
