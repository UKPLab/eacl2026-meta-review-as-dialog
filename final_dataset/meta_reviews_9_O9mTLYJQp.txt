Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper titled "Label Noise in Adversarial Training: A Novel Perspective to Study Robust Overfitting". Can you provide me with more information about the paper and its reviews?

Dialogue agent: Of course, what would you like to know?

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me more about the paper's contributions?

Dialogue agent: The paper shows that adversarial training can introduce label noise through both theoretical and empirical investigations, and proposes a new adversarial training formulation that uses temperature rescaling and interpolation to mitigate the robust overfitting problem. The paper also provides a clear and in-depth theoretical investigation of the label noise caused by adversarial perturbations and its connection to robust overfitting.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper according to the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 mentioned that the problem of robust overfitting is relevant and the connection to label noise is interesting, and that the proposed training method improves over several existing methods. Review 2 also highlighted the novel observation of label noise and the theoretical analysis, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed method. Review 3 mentioned the interesting observation and well-presented theoretical analysis.

Meta-reviewer: Thanks for the summary. Are there any weaknesses or concerns mentioned by the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 pointed out some assumptions that the authors made and concerns about the novelty of the proposed training scheme. Review 2 mentioned the need for a rigorous theoretical analysis to establish the connection between label noise and robust overfitting, and the lack of discussion on the severity of label noise in realistic applications. Review 3 raised concerns about the gap between theory and method, the need for more diverse experiments, and the lack of clarity on the validation set used to determine optimal parameter values.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on these reviews, what is your recommendation for accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue agent: All three reviews gave a rating of 6, which is a weak accept. There are some weaknesses and concerns raised by the reviewers, but they also acknowledge the strengths and contributions of the paper. As a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to provide an opinion or recommendation, but I can provide you with the reviewers' ratings and comments for you to make an informed decision.
