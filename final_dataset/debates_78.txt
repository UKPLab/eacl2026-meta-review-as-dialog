Decision Maker: Hello, can you tell me more about the threat of cyber war? Is it something that we should be worried about?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. The statement of the proposition is whether the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated. While it is true that there are risks to the internet and there are malicious actors out there, we believe that the threat of cyber war has been overstated.

Decision Maker: But don't leading experts on cyber war warn us about the severity of the threat? I read that there are daily digital Pearl Harbors happening.

Dialogue Agent: Yes, that is a statement from one expert. However, we believe that these statements overstate the problem. It's important to remember that there are many different actors out there with varying intentions, and not all of them pose a threat to national security.

Decision Maker: But what about the U.S. military networks seeing hundreds of thousands of probes a day? Doesn't that indicate a serious threat?

Dialogue Agent: While that number may seem alarming, it's important to note that probes do not necessarily equate to attacks. These probes could come from a variety of sources, including non-malicious actors such as researchers or companies testing their own security.

Decision Maker: But I heard one of the opponents in the debate compare the threat of cyber warfare to nuclear war. That sounds incredibly serious.

Dialogue Agent: While that comparison may sound frightening, it's important to consider the context in which it was made and the specific arguments presented. We believe that the threat of cyber war has been exaggerated, but that doesn't mean it should be ignored completely. It's important to have strong cybersecurity measures in place to protect against any potential attacks.

Decision Maker: Thank you for your insights. It seems like there are many different opinions on this topic.

Dialogue Agent: Yes, there are certainly varying opinions and perspectives. As a neutral agent, it's our goal to provide information and context to help people make informed decisions and come to their own conclusions.
