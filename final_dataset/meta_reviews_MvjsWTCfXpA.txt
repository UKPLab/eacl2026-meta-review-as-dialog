Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have been assigned to decide whether to accept or reject the paper titled "Agent Forecasting at Flexible Horizons using ODE Flows." Can you give me an overview of the reviews, please?

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. There are three reviews for the paper. Review 1 rates the paper as borderline accept, with a confidence score of 3. Review 2 also rates the paper as borderline accept, with a confidence score of 3, but raises a conceptual doubt. Review 3 also rates the paper as borderline accept, with a confidence score of 3, but raises concerns about the clarity of writing and the experimental evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you explain more about the concerns raised in Review 2?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 questions whether the same network used to transform a Gaussian latent distribution to the prediction at the first time point is the same as the one used to transform predictions at various time points to similar distributions at later times. The reviewer wonders whether these two "regimes" are very different in terms of transport and if this has an impact on the network's capacity to solve the task.

Meta-reviewer: And what about the concerns raised in Review 3?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 suggests that the writing could be clearer and raises doubts about part of the experimental evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Can you tell me more about the paper's type and the results presented?

Dialogue agent: The paper is long, and the results presented appear to be interesting for the community, although they are not described clearly enough.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews and the type of paper, would you say that the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation. My role is to provide information and respond to your questions.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. What can you tell me about the reviewers' confidence scores?

Dialogue agent: All three reviewers have a confidence score of 3, which means that they are fairly confident in their evaluations.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, the type of paper, and the confidence scores of the reviewers, I will make a decision. Thank you for your assistance.

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. Let me know if you have any further questions.
