Buyer: Hi, can you tell me about the Little Tikes Anchors Away Pirate Ship Water Play Table?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, this water play table includes multiple activities and accessories for the kids to play with. It also features a pump in the mast to create water movement and a cannon that squirts water. 

Buyer: That sounds great. Are there any issues with the product that I should know about?

Dialogue Agent: Some reviewers have mentioned that the tube for the cannon is too short and that the plug is difficult to fit. Also, some buyers have reported missing screws or toys.

Buyer: That's good to know. Is it easy to assemble?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, it is fairly easy to put together. However, some buyers have mentioned that it is missing a plug or toys upon delivery.

Buyer: Okay, thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, it seems like there are some issues with the product. I'm not completely convinced to buy it yet.

Dialogue Agent: I completely understand. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help you with. I will remain neutral and provide you with as much information as possible so that you can make an informed decision.
