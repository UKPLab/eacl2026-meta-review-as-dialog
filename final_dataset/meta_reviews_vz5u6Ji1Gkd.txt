Meta-reviewer: Hello, I am the meta-reviewer for this paper. I have read the reviews and have a few questions for you, the dialogue agent.

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I am here to answer any questions you may have.

Meta-reviewer: First of all, can you confirm the paper's title and type?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the title of the paper is "Knowledge Graph Construction with R2RML and RML: An ETL System-based Overview" and it is classified as a long paper.

Meta-reviewer: Great, thank you. Review 1 has some criticism regarding the paper's framing. Can you tell me more about that?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 states that the authors position their work as a broad study on ETL approaches but restrict themselves to declarative languages, specifically open-source systems that support R2RML and RML. The reviewer suggests that the paper oversells its contributions, mostly in sections 1 and 3. The reviewer highlights that the set of requirements in Section 3 are arbitrary and not properly motivated.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Does Review 2 share the same criticism?

Dialogue agent: No, Review 2 focuses on the positive aspects of the paper. It highlights that the paper is well-written and easy to read and praises the authors for their qualitative analysis of the distinctive features of each system, conformance study, and evaluation of performance and scalability using the GTFS-Madrid-Benchmark.

Meta-reviewer: How about Review 3?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 also praises the authors for presenting a clearly focused, defined, and executed comparison of ETL-based (R2)RML engines on a benchmark dataset. However, the reviewer has a concern with the title of the paper, suggesting that the focus should be more pointed out as on declarative ETL systems that implement (R2)RML mappings.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Can you tell me more about the reviewers' ratings and confidence levels?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 gave the paper a rating of 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold, and gave a confidence level of 5, stating that the reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature. Review 2 gave the paper a rating of 7, which is good, and a confidence level of 5, also stating that the reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature. Finally, Review 3 gave the paper a rating of 8, which is in the top 50% of accepted papers, and a confidence level of 4, stating that the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Considering these reviews, do you have any recommendations?

Dialogue agent: I must refrain from providing recommendations or opinions. My role is to provide relevant information about the reviews to help you make your decision.

Meta-reviewer: I appreciate your professionalism. Based on these reviews, I will take reviewer confidence in consideration but will also look carefully at the concerns raised in Review 1 regarding the paper's framing. Thank you for your help.
