 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper called "KnowFi: Knowledge Extraction from Long Fictional Texts". Can you tell me a little bit about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new method for relation extraction from long fictional texts, called KnowFi. It introduces a novel benchmark, LoFiDo, and presents a two-module neural architecture to address challenges such as sparsity and distant supervision.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are some of the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper presents a new task and benchmark, which is an important step towards knowledge construction from books. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the proposed method and its performance on the new benchmark.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, what about the weaknesses?

Dialogue Agent: The paper lacks details on some of the model and experiment aspects, such as the prototype representation and the aggregation layer. Additionally, the authors do not provide sufficient information on the dataset statistics and the validation set.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the reviewer confidence?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the reviewer confidence is marginally above the acceptance threshold. Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 have a high level of confidence in the evaluation, while Reviewer 2 has a lower level of confidence.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you summarize the main concerns of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers have concerns about the lack of details on some of the model and experiment aspects, the dataset statistics, and the validation set. Reviewer 2 also raises questions about the ranking step and the choice of TF-IDF for passage ranking.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews and the dialogue, I will make my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: Of course! Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
