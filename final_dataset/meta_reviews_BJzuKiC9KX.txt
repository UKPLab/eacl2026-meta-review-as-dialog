Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent, for being here with me today. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Revisiting Reweighted Wake-Sleep", and I would like to dive deeper into some aspects before making a final decision.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for having me. I'm here to answer any questions you may have about the reviews.

Meta-Reviewer: I see that Reviewer 1 mentioned the lack of stronger baselines and the need for a more rigorous analysis. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Reviewer 1 pointed out that incorporating stronger baselines, such as the ones mentioned in the review, could improve the paper's comparison results. As for the lack of rigorous analysis, the review suggests that the observations alone may not be novel enough for an ICLR paper without further explanation.

Meta-Reviewer: Interesting. And what about Reviewer 2's comment on the lack of rigorous analysis of why RWS performs better than IWAE?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2 points out the need for a more formal justification of the propositions made in the paper. The review suggests that while the observations are interesting, a more rigorous analysis would strengthen the paper's argument for why RWS is more appropriate for discrete latent variables.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Now, Reviewer 3 had some questions regarding specific parts of the paper. Can you address those?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. Reviewer 3 had a few questions, including how KL divergence was estimated in Figure 1 (right), why IWAE is said to suffer from diminishing returns after a certain point, and why RWS doesn't achieve better performance when the number of particles increases in Figure 4. The review also raised some clarity issues with the terminology used in the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Based on all of these reviews and their feedback, how confident are you in the evaluations, dialogue agent?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 is fairly confident in their evaluation, with a level 3 confidence. Reviews 2 and 3 are confident, but not absolutely certain, with level 3 and 4 confidences, respectively.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on all of this, I believe I am confident in my decision. Thank you for your help, dialogue agent.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. It was my pleasure to assist you in your decision-making process.
