Meta-reviewer: Thank you for joining me today. I have read the reviews for the paper "Gaussian Copula Embeddings" and I have a few questions for you.

Dialogue agent: Of course, I am here to assist you in any way possible.

Meta-reviewer: The first review mentioned that the contribution of the paper is insignificant. Can you elaborate on that?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to express opinions or recommendations. However, I can mention that the authors addressed this concern and clarified the benefits of their proposed method. They also increased their score by 1 in response to the reviewer's feedback. 

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful information. The second review seems quite positive. What can you tell me about the strengths of the paper highlighted in the review?

Dialogue agent: According to the second review, the proposed model using Gaussian copula for embedding learning is novel and interesting. The paper also proposes an order preserving likelihood and corresponding variational autoencoder for efficient and effective inference. Moreover, the model shows significant improvement in comparison to other methods in various experiments from different domains.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Now, the third review suggests some missing information and a lack of justification for the choice of benchmarks. What can you tell me about these concerns?

Dialogue agent: The third review mentions that the paper could do more to relate generally to other deep learning models that employ a notion of context. The reviewers believe that some justification for the choice of comparator methods or benchmarks could be given. The third reviewer finds that there does appear to be some missing information in the paper. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. This is helpful to know. Overall, how confident are you in the assessments made by the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, my confidence level in the assessments made by the reviewers is provided along with the reviews. According to my calculations, the confidence level of the first reviewer is 3, the second reviewer is 4, and the third reviewer is 3. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews and the information you have provided, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. However, I would like to know more about the ethics concerns briefly mentioned at the end of the paper. 

Dialogue agent: The authors have briefly indicated that as usual, "such tools must be used responsibly to avoid negative societal impact." However, they could provide more explicit information about what the concerns are to avoid any potential negative consequences that might arise from the tool's usage. 

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Thank you for your assistance.
