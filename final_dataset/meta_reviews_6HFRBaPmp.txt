Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Doubly-Asynchronous Value Iteration: Making Value Iteration Asynchronous in Actions." Can you provide me with more information about the paper's strengths and weaknesses?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, Meta-reviewer. The paper proposes a generalization of asynchronous value iteration from states to actions and states. This proposed algorithm, Doubly-Asynchronous Value Iteration (DAVI), maximizes over a sampled subset of actions of arbitrary size, and it has been proved to converge to the optimal value function with probability one at a near-geometric rate with probability 1-δ. The computational complexity bound for DAVI nearly matches a previously established bound for VI, and the convergence rate is nearly a geometric rate. Furthermore, DAVI returns a near-optimal policy in computation time that nearly matches a previously established bound for VI.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you tell me about the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: There are no major weaknesses mentioned in the reviews. However, Review 3 did mention that the empirical performance gain could be improved by evaluating the proposed method on a more challenging environment. In addition, the entire sampling process may still be prohibitively expensive, which could be problematic if paired with catastrophically forgetting networks.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, the paper appears technically solid, with novel ideas. However, I am also interested in the reviewer confidence. Can you tell me more about that?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 had a confidence rating of 1, indicating that their assessment was an educated guess and that the submission was not in their area or was difficult to understand, suggesting that their rating of a strong acceptance may not carry as much weight. Reviewer 2 had a confidence rating of 4, indicating that they were confident in their assessment, but not absolutely certain. Reviewer 3 had a confidence rating of 3, also indicating some level of confidence but still with room for uncertainty.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, Dialogue Agent. Based on the reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper. The strengths mentioned in the reviews seem to outweigh the weaknesses, particularly with regard to the algorithm's convergence and computational complexity properties. However, I do take into consideration the varying levels of reviewer confidence. Thank you for your assistance in the decision-making process.
