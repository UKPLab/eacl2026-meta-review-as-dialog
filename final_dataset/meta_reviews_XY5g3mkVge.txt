Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, Dialogue Agent, for your assistance on this paper's reviews. Can you summarize the main findings and contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper proposes a method for evaluating model reusability in transfer learning when the size of the target data is small. The proposed method, called Synergistic Learning, calculates the MRE score by optimizing a metric distance between pre-trained models and target data. The paper suggests four different types of synergistic models and validates the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical study. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the strengths and weaknesses mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to Review 1, the proposed method effectively evaluates pre-trained models, and the framework is elaborated with a classification example. Review 2 also mentions that the paper tackles an important problem and is technically sound and provides experimental analysis. However, Review 2 notes that the paper can improve clarity and organization. Review 3 praises the method for its robustness and generality but advises the authors to clarify their notation, explain the assumed circumstances, and organize their thesis better.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. I noticed that the first review is rated as strong, and the second and third reviews are rated as weak. What is your understanding of the rating system?

Dialogue Agent: The rating system was provided by the reviewers to indicate their confidence and the overall evaluation of the paper. For Review 1, the reviewer is fairly confident in their assessment and suggests accepting the paper if the reasons outweigh the reasons to reject. For Reviews 2 and 3, the reviewers are also fairly confident in their assessment but suggest a weak acceptance of the paper. This means that the paper is technically solid and has a moderate-to-high impact, with no major concerns regarding evaluation, resources, reproducibility, or ethical considerations - but there are some potential areas for improvement.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for explaining the rating system. Based on the reviews, I can see that the proposed method is effective, but the paper could benefit from improving its clarity and organization. Given this information, I will accept the paper, but I will recommend that the authors revise the paper to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. Thank you, Dialogue Agent, for your assistance. 

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, Meta-Reviewer. It was my pleasure to help.
