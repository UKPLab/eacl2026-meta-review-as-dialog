Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me to discuss this paper's reviews. Can you summarize the main points of the reviews for me?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper analyzes the failure modes of fine-tuning and joint training for multi-task learning in computer vision and proposes a meta-learning algorithm called MeRLin to address these failures. The reviews primarily focus on the paper's quality, clarity, originality, significance, pros and cons, and minor details.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 1 rates the paper marginally below the acceptance threshold, while Review 2 and Review 3 rate the paper marginally above the acceptance threshold. Can you tell me more about their reasons for these ratings?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 appreciates the paper's principled approach to analyzing failure modes but has concerns about the significance of the work, particularly regarding the compromise of the transfer learning setting and the lack of statistical tests of significance. Review 2 finds the paper insightful and well-written but suggests more discussion of other domain adaptation works and comparison to previous work. Review 3 considers the paper well-motivated and well-written but finds the experimental results not entirely convincing due to potential overfitting and lack of direct comparison to results from previous work.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. Based on these reviews, I am curious about the paper's originality and its contribution to the field of transfer learning. Can you provide more information on these aspects?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 gives the paper a 4/5 for originality and acknowledges the paper's clear relationships to previous works on parameter-space meta-learning and automatic hyperparameter tuning. Review 2 also notes that the paper is well-motivated and linked to existing work but would like more discussion of other domain adaptation works. Review 3 states that the paper is interesting and well-motivated but finds the main message less than 100% clear.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Finally, can you tell me more about the reviews' evaluation and confidence levels?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 rates the confidence in the evaluation as a 3 out of 5, meaning the reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct. Review 2 rates the confidence as a 4 out of 5, indicating that the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. Review 3 does not provide a confidence rating for the evaluation.
