 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Optimistic mirror descent in saddle-point problems: Going the extra (gradient) mile":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Optimistic mirror descent in saddle-point problems: Going the extra (gradient) mile". Can you tell me what this paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper presents an optimistic mirror descent algorithm for solving minmax optimization problems. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge under a coherence property, and the authors provide experimental results that support their findings.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What do the reviewers think of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews provided, Reviewer 1 thinks the paper is good and recommends acceptance with a confidence rating of 7. Reviewer 2 also recommends acceptance but with a lower confidence rating of 5. Reviewer 3 has some concerns about the coherence property and the specificity of the sufficient conditions provided.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the coherence property and how it relates to the paper's contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The coherence property is a new assumption that replaces the traditional monotonicity assumption in mirror descent methods. The authors show that under this assumption, the optimistic mirror descent algorithm can converge to a saddle point of the minmax optimization problem. The paper's main contribution is the introduction of this new assumption and the development of an algorithm that can take advantage of it.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. What about the relationship between the coherence property and existing literature on mirror descent methods?

Dialogue Agent: The authors note that the coherence property is closely related to the pseudo-monotone property, which has been studied in the literature. However, the coherence property is a weaker assumption, which allows for a broader range of applications. The authors also mention that their algorithm can be seen as a stochastic extension of existing extragradient methods, but with the added flexibility of using Bregman distance instead of European distance.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the experimental results? Do they support the theoretical findings?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors provide experimental results on several benchmarks, and the results support their findings. However, Reviewer 3 notes that the specificity of the sufficient conditions provided may limit the applicability of the method to existing GAN models.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews and your summary, I think I have a good understanding of the paper's contributions and limitations. What are your recommendations for the paper's acceptance?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the discussion, I recommend accepting the paper with a confidence rating of 6. The reviewers generally agree that the paper is well-written and presents an interesting contribution, but there are some concerns about the specificity of the sufficient conditions provided.
