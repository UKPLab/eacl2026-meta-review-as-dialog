Meta-Reviewer: I have reviewed the three reviews and it seems that the paper has some good points and some areas for improvement. The main contribution seems to be the proposal of a new prior distribution for latent variables in a VAE, which encourages multi-modality in the posterior distribution. Review 1 highlights the three main contributions of the paper, which include the proposed Dirichlet prior, techniques for reparametrization using Gamma random variables, and a way to overcome the "component collapse" issue in Stick-breaking VAE. However, Review 1 also points out that there may be existing methods that can achieve similar results, so it would be beneficial to compare the proposed method to these methods to fully evaluate its novelty and impact.

The second review points out that the combination of inverse CDF reparametrization of Gamma distribution and transformation to Dirichlet has been done before, and suggests that the novelty of the paper may not be significant. However, Review 2 does state that the observation that DirVAE does not suffer from latent value collapsing is interesting and could be a valuable contribution.

Review 3 generally has high praise for the quality and significance of the paper, while also noting that the idea is a combination of already known techniques. The reviewer suggests that a clearer motivation for the use of the Dirichlet prior could be given in the introduction.

Based on these reviews, it seems that the paper has some good contributions, but also some areas for improvement and clarification. I would like to ask the dialogue agent for more information on the experimental results, specifically in terms of how the proposed method compares to existing methods, and if there are any limitations or areas for further research that the authors suggest.
