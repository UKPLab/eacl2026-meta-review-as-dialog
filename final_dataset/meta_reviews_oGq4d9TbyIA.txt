Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your reviews on "Uniform-Precision Neural Network Quantization via Neural Channel Expansion." After carefully considering your feedback, I have a few follow-up questions for the dialogue agent. Can you tell me more about the novelty of the proposed method compared to existing approaches, such as those mentioned in Review 3?

Dialogue Agent: While some aspects of the proposed method, like the use of neural architecture search and quantization, have been explored before, the unique contribution here is the use of neural channel expansion. This allows for the adjustment of network structure to account for performance degradation from uniform-precision quantization, and ultimately leads to improved accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, while Review 3 mentions some existing works that also explore network width and quantization, the proposed NCE method is distinct in its use of a sensitivity-to-quantization signal to adjust the width of each layer.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that explanation. Now, Review 1 includes some concern about the comparison tables and the impact of different network sizes. Can you elaborate on this issue?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 brings up a valid point about the comparison tables potentially being unfair due to the differences in network sizes. To address this concern, the authors could uniformly increase channel widths in the "w/o NCE" baseline to test whether the accuracy boost is from NCE learning the layer sensitivities or simply from a bigger model. Additionally, for larger networks like VGG and ResNet-50 where NCE shows more compelling results, the authors could provide more detailed information on which layers were reduced in size. 

Meta-reviewer: That makes sense. Finally, Review 2 raises some questions about the novelty of the proposed method and potential comparisons to existing approaches. Can you comment on these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: While the proposed NCE method is based on the TAS algorithm, the use of neural channel expansion is a novel contribution that has not been explored extensively in previous work. Additionally, the authors do provide an analysis of the effect of channel expansion for quantization error compensation, which further highlights the novelty of the approach. As for comparisons to existing methods, the authors could consider including comparisons to the works mentioned in Review 3 that also aim to reduce quantization error by increasing network width. It would also be valuable to explore the proposed method on different bitwidth quantizations beyond the 2-bit setting.
