 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Distilling Image Classifiers in Object Detectors":

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Distilling Image Classifiers in Object Detectors". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a method for distilling a low-compute object detector using a classification backbone as teacher. The authors use a logit matching approach for classification distillation and a feature matching loss for localization distillation. The proposed method improves on the non-distilled baseline student detectors and competes with prior related detector-to-detector distillation works.

Meta-Reviewer: Interesting. What do the reviewers think of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews provided, Reviewer 1 rated the paper as "Marginally below the acceptance threshold" with a confidence level of 4. Reviewer 2 rated the paper as "Ok but not good enough - rejection" with a confidence level of 4. Reviewer 3 rated the paper as "Good paper, accept" with a confidence level of 3.

Meta-Reviewer: Can you summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: The reviews highlight the paper's contributions to the field of object detection and distillation. However, some reviewers noted that the paper's claims were slightly overstated, and the method may not be as novel as claimed. Additionally, one reviewer noted that the ablation study could have been more comprehensive.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews and your summary, what is your recommendation for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide a personal opinion or recommendation. However, I can provide a summary of the reviews and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, as requested by the meta-reviewer. The final decision should be based on the importance of reviewer confidence and the significance of the paper's contributions to the field.
