Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you tell me your overall impression of the paper "Fairness without Demographics through Knowledge Distillation"?

Dialogue Agent: Hello. Based on the reviews provided, I believe the paper presents a novel approach to achieving fairness through knowledge distillation without demographic information, and the experiments have shown promising results.

Meta-Reviewer: Can you explain to me the main technical contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper proposes a method to use knowledge distillation to improve fairness in the student model by using soft labels from the overfitted teacher model. This approach imposes a smoothness constraint on the student model while improving fairness, specifically disparate impact and equalized odds.

Meta-Reviewer: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The strengths of the paper include its clear organization and well-written structure. The authors propose an alternative method to improve fairness when demographic information is unavailable and analyze the theoretical impact of label smoothing and knowledge distillation. Additionally, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by improving fairness without sacrificing accuracy. However, the paper does contain some weaknesses, such as lacking a clear motivation and novelty description and not discussing the interpretability of the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors could improve the procedure's logical and intuitive portrayal, add a proper figure, and refine relevant paragraphs. There are also minor typos and missing references in the paper, which need to be addressed.

Meta-Reviewer: It seems like the paper has some room for improvement based on the reviews you provided. Do you think the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue Agent: Both Review 1 and Review 3 recommend accepting the paper while providing several suggestions for improvement. Review 2, on the other hand, recommends borderline rejection. However, the comments indicate that the evaluation may be limited, and it would be beneficial to disentangle different factors that contribute to fairness. Thus, based on the reviews, I believe the paper can be accepted with some improvements.
