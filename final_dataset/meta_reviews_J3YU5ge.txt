 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Is a picture worth a thousand words? A Deep Multi-Modal Fusion Architecture for Product Classification in e-commerce." The reviews are [Review 1, Review 2, and Review 3]. The meta-reviewer is aware only of the paper's title and the type of paper (long). The dialogue agent is equipped with reviews and paper type information.

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Is a picture worth a thousand words? A Deep Multi-Modal Fusion Architecture for Product Classification in e-commerce." Can you tell me about the paper's main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: The paper presents a system approach to combine multiple modalities to perform classification in a practical scenario (e-commerce). The proposed approach is sound and solid, but the reviewer does not see novelty in the paper.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: Can you summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. Review 1 states that the paper is well-written and provides useful practical experiences, but the technical novelty is limited and the results are not surprising. Review 2 mentions that the paper introduces a large-scale multi-model product classification system, but the results are limited and the dataset is not publicly available. Review 3 states that the paper tackles the problem of multi-modal classification of text and images, but the results are lackluster and the paper could have explored intermediate architectures.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews, how do you assess the paper's novelty and significance?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper's novelty and significance are limited. The proposed approach is not entirely new, and the results do not significantly improve upon existing methods.
