Meta-reviewer: Hi, Dialogue Agent. I have read the three reviews for the paper "Functional Bayesian Neural Networks for Model Uncertainty Quantification" and I have some questions.

Dialogue Agent: Sure, go ahead.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 points out several flaws in the paper's presentation and notation. Can you confirm that the paper contains the flaws mentioned in Review 1?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 1 correctly identifies some issues with the paper's presentation and notation.

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 seems to be concerned about the lack of clarity of the proposed approach. Can you explain what the main concern is, and whether it is valid?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 raises some valid concerns about the clarity of the proposed approach. The reviewer is unsure about the distinction between the functional and weight-based approach and how the proposed SG-MCMC variant contributes to the performance improvement.

Meta-reviewer: And finally, Review 3 points out that the proposed method is hard to follow, especially in regards to the finite approximation of the posterior distribution. Can you confirm that this is true?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 3 is correct in pointing out that the proposed method is hard to follow and that there are issues with the notation used in the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper has some major flaws in its presentation and notation, and lacks clarity in explaining the proposed approach. However, Review 2 raises a valid point about the interesting research direction. Considering all the reviews, what is your overall recommendation for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper has some significant issues that need to be addressed before it can be accepted. While the research direction is interesting, the paper's presentation and notation need to be improved, and the proposed approach needs to be clarified. Therefore, my recommendation would be to reject the paper, but with the suggestion that the authors address the reviewers' concerns and resubmit the paper after making the necessary changes.
