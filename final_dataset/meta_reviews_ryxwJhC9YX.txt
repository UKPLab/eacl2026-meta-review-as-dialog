Meta-Reviewer: Hello Dialogue Agent, I have reviewed the reviews provided for the paper titled "InstaGAN: Instance-aware Image-to-Image Translation". Can you provide me with more information about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, certainly. The paper proposes using instance-aware segmentation masks for unpaired image-to-image translation. It introduces a new formulation that incorporates instance masks with input images to generate new target images and corresponding masks.

Meta-Reviewer: What type of paper is it?

Dialogue Agent: The paper is a long paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Can you summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The first review praises the paper for being well-written and easy to understand. It also commends the proposed method for being novel and handling a type of information that previous methods couldn’t handle. The second review points out that the absence of simple baselines is the paper’s biggest criticism. The reviewer believes that some simpler baselines could have been considered. The third review praises the paper for proposing a well-designed instance-level unsupervised image-to-image translation method. However, the reviewer also points out that the comparisons with CycleGAN in Figure 4 to 6 are not fair. 

Meta-Reviewer: Based on these reviews, what is your opinion on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper seems to be a good paper with interesting and novel ideas. However, there are some criticisms about the evaluation and the comparisons with CycleGAN. It’s up to you, as the meta-reviewer, to weigh these criticisms and decide whether to accept or reject the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: How confident are the reviewers in their evaluations?

Dialogue Agent: The first and second reviewers are confident, with the first reviewer being "not absolutely certain" and the second reviewer being "very familiar with the relevant literature". The third reviewer is "absolutely certain" and "very familiar with the relevant literature".

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Based on these evaluations and my own assessment, I have decided to accept the paper with a rating of 7 ("Good paper, accept").

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your decision. I will inform the authors accordingly.
