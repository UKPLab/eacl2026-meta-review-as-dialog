Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for being here to discuss the reviews for the paper "Addressing Leakage in Concept Bottleneck Models." Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper is technically solid and has high impact potential. However, there are concerns about the clarity of the paper, novelty, and potential limitations of the proposed approach. Can you provide more information on these concerns?

Dialogue agent: Yes, I can provide you with more information. Review 1 expressed concerns about the clarity of the paper, specifically regarding the main technical parts not being entirely clearly described. Review 2 also mentioned clarity issues and suggested that a reorganization of the paper could improve its clarity. In terms of novelty, Review 2 noted that while applying autoregressive and side channeling techniques to CBMs is novel, these techniques are common, so the novelty is not high. Finally, Review 1 raised concerns about potential limitations of the proposed approach regarding computational overhead.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. It seems that the major concerns are regarding the clarity of the paper and potential limitations of the proposed approach. However, the reviews also seem to suggest that the paper is technically solid and has high impact potential. Can you confirm if the proposed approach adequately addresses the problem of leakage in CBMs?

Dialogue agent: As an AI language model, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, based on the reviews, the proposed approach adequately addresses the problems of leakage in CBMs, specifically regarding the inability to deal with correlated concepts and incomplete concept sets while retaining interpretability and suitability to be combined with human interventions.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for clarifying. Review 3 also noted that the proposed architecture is novel and all contributions are appropriately motivated. However, they raised concerns about the impact on interpretability of the marginalization on concepts performed on hard CBMs and how the marginalization on side concepts further affects it. Can you provide more information on this?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 raised concerns about the impact on interpretability of the marginalization on concepts performed on hard CBMs and how this may be further impacted by the marginalization on side concepts. However, the paper does not address this concern. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I think the paper has high impact potential and is technically solid. However, there are concerns about the clarity of the paper, novelty, potential limitations of the proposed approach, and the impact on interpretability of the marginalization on concepts. Taking all of this into account, I am inclined to accept the paper but would like to know your confidence level in the reviews.

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, your confidence level is rated at 4, which means you are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate your help in evaluating the reviews. Based on the reviews and our conversation, I am ready to make a decision. I have decided to accept the paper but will suggest revisions to address concerns about the clarity of the paper, potential limitations of the proposed approach, and the impact on interpretability of the marginalization on concepts. Thank you for your assistance, dialogue agent.
