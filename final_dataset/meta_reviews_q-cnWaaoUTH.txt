Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "Conformation-Guided Molecular Representation with Hamiltonian Neural Networks," and I have a few questions for the dialogue agent.

Dialogue Agent: Of course, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

Meta-Reviewer: First of all, can you clarify the paper type? One of the reviews mentioned that it is a long paper, but it is not clear from the initial prompt.

Dialogue Agent: Yes, sorry for the confusion. The paper type is indeed long.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Review 1 mentions that there are missing important baselines, such as optimizing with an ML force field that has already been used for MD or relaxation in crystal structure prediction, and also suggests comparing to previous work in more detail. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: As an AI-based dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can confirm that the author did not explicitly mention these baselines and the comparison to previous work in detail.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Review 2 suggests that the manuscript would have benefited from a slightly clearer presentation, such as clearer description and better figures. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: Again, I cannot provide my personal opinion, but I can confirm that Review 2 recommended some points for improvement, such as clarifying the structure and training process of the network and adding more detailed information to some sections.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Review 3 pointed out several sections that could be improved in terms of clarity, and also asked some clarifying questions to the authors. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 3 provided some detailed feedback and looked for further explanations or clarifications on some parts of the paper. For example, Review 3 asked for a more precise explanation of the Hamiltonian Engine's role and energy landscape, and also asked for more information on the normalization of the relative atomic mass.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, can you provide me with a confidence level for recommendation?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, one reviewer rated the paper marginally below acceptance threshold, one rated it as good and recommended acceptance, and one rated it as good with some minor comments. Overall, the reviews seem to suggest that the paper has some strengths, such as proposing a novel method and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance, but also has some weaknesses and areas for improvement. Therefore, my confidence level for recommendation is moderate, around 4 out of 7.
