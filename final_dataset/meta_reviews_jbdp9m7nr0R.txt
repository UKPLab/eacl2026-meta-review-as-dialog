Meta-reviewer: Hello, it's great to have three reviews for the paper "How Would The Viewer Feel? Estimating Wellbeing From Video Scenarios". I have read all three reviews and I must say that there are some contrasting opinions. Review 1 seems to have some concerns around the dataset's audio signal usage and exclusion, while review 2 has raised some bias-related doubts due to the absence of annotator backgrounds. Review 3 seems to have no critical issues with the paper. Can you tell me more about what you think about these reviews, dialogue agent?

Dialogue agent:Certainly, the paper presents two large datasets, VCE and V2V, to predict viewers' emotional reactions and wellbeing while watching videos. Review 1 acknowledged the novelty of these datasets and the potential for end-to-end representation learning. However, they have raised the concern around annotators using audio signals in the absence of video signals, leading to ambiguity in labels, and also the exclusion of audio signals from the final dataset. Review 2 has cited issues around bias when annotator backgrounds are not mentioned and subjective labels for mixed emotion videos. Lastly, Review 3 has appreciated the paper's contributions and has no significant issues found.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on these reviews, can you provide any insights on whether we should accept or reject this paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent who analyzed the reviews, I cannot impose my opinion in recommending whether to reject or accept this paper. But I can say that Review 1 has given a rating of 7, indicating that it's a good paper, and Review 2 has given a rating of 8, indicating that it's in the top 50% of the accepted papers. On the other hand, Review 3 rated it a 9, suggesting that it's in the top 15% of the accepted papers and a strong accept. Based on these ratings, the paper seems to have good to strong acceptability chances, considering it's a long paper and has a clear contribution.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, that's insightful. However, I am concerned about the potential for the audio signal to impact the quality of labels. Can you please provide me with more information on that?

Dialogue agent: Absolutely, Review 1 pointed out that the annotators were allowed to use audio signals while annotating videos, leading to uncertainty and ambiguity in labels. The authors, in response, also mentioned this concern and noted that the annotators were encouraged to take notes of the samples in which only audio-oriented emotion annotations were made. The authors further decided to exclude the audio signal from the final dataset to avoid misinterpretations since the datasets aimed to predict emotions from the visual content only. Therefore, the authors took care of this issue and removed the audio signal. 

Meta-reviewer: Yes, I see. The removal of the audio signal from the final dataset makes sense. I believe that this won't impact the quality of the dataset substantially, and the dataset still has significant contributions. Based on the ratings and the fact that the datasets are largest of their kind, I'm leaning towards accepting this paper. Do you have any other insights that can help me in the decision-making process?

Dialogue agent: I would say that it's essential to consider the confidence level of the reviewers as well. Review 1 and 2 have given a confidence score of 4, meaning that they are relatively confident in their evaluation but not completely certain. However, Review 3 didn't indicate any sign of weakness and presented a high rating (9) indicative of strong acceptability. Overall, the reviewers' confidence levels suggest that the paper is well-written and within the scope of the conference, making it an acceptable submission.
