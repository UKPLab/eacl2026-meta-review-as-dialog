 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Machine Translation With Weakly Paired Bilingual Documents":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Machine Translation With Weakly Paired Bilingual Documents". Can you tell me a little bit about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a method for training a machine translation system using weakly paired bilingual documents from Wikipedia. The method involves mining documents that refer to the same topic and extracting parallel sentences from these documents to train the translation model.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The main contributions of the paper are the proposal of a new method for training machine translation systems using weakly paired bilingual documents, and the empirical validation of the method on two high-resource language pairs.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the reviewer's opinions on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Reviewer 1 believes that the paper proposes a novel approach and provides a clear and solid empirical validation. However, Reviewer 2 notes that the introduction gives the impression that the method will be applied to low-resource language pairs, but the authors only evaluate the method on two high-resource language pairs. Reviewer 3 praises the paper's novelty and clarity but suggests that the authors could further strengthen the empirical validation by testing on low-resource language pairs.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Can you tell me more about the method proposed in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The method involves mining documents that refer to the same topic and extracting parallel sentences from these documents. The authors then use these parallel sentences to train a machine translation model using two additional losses, one that encourages good translation of the extracted parallel sentences and another one that forces the distribution of words to match at the document level.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the first review, Reviewer 1? What are their opinions on the method?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 believes that the method is well-motivated and the proposed objective function is interesting. However, they suggest that the authors could provide more details on the notation and the constraint of matching the topic distribution.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the reviews, I think the paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold. What do you think?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I agree with the meta-reviewer's assessment. The paper proposes a novel approach and provides a solid empirical validation, but the introduction could be improved and the authors could further strengthen the empirical validation by testing on low-resource language pairs.
