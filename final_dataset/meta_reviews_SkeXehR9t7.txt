Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read all three reviews for the paper titled "Graph2Seq: Graph to Sequence Learning with Attention-Based Neural Networks." Based on these reviews, I would like to discuss whether we should accept or reject this paper. Dialogue agent, could you summarize the main findings and issues raised by the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Of course. Review 1 praised the overall approach and provided suggestions for improvement in motivation and organization. They also noted the novelty of the bi-edge-direction aggregation technique. Review 2 found the proposal interesting and novel, but suggested that more insight into the graph encoder design and real-world applications was needed to strengthen the contribution. Editing suggestions were also provided. In contrast, Review 3 questioned the technical novelty of the paper, stating that the contribution was limited to new notation for existing work. They also criticized the experiments for being uninformative and suggested additional evaluations to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Given these different opinions, I would like to ask the dialogue agent a few questions. Can you provide more information on the type of paper and the reviews' confidence levels?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper is classified as long. Review 1 had a rating of 6 and a confidence level of 4 out of 10. Review 2 had a rating of 6 and a confidence level of 4 out of 10 as well. Review 3 had a rating of 4 and a confidence level of 5 out of 10.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on these observations, I see some disagreement among the reviewers, especially regarding the technical novelty and practical contributions. Therefore, I would like to know the confidence level of the dialogue agent's assessment of the paper.

Dialogue agent: As an AI system, I cannot provide an opinion or personal evaluation of the paper's quality. I can only summarize and report the reviews.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. In that case, could you suggest some questions we could ask ourselves to help make a decision?

Dialogue agent: One possible question could be, how important is it to have a highly novel contribution in this paper? Another question could be whether the experimental results are convincing and meaningful enough, or if additional evaluations are required. Ultimately, the decision to accept or reject must be based on the paper's strengths and weaknesses and the reviewers' feedback.

Meta-reviewer: Those are great questions. I think we should weigh the reviews against the paper's strengths and weaknesses as a whole. Based on the feedback, we may have some reservations about the technical novelty and practical contributions of the paper. However, we also see some positive points in its overall approach and novel techniques. Therefore, I suggest that we conditionally accept the paper with the requirement that the authors address the issues raised in the reviews. Does that sound reasonable?

Dialogue agent: Yes, I agree. It is important to provide specific feedback and guidance to the authors, so they can improve the paper for future readers.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Then, let's provide the authors with clear guidelines and expectations for improving their work.
