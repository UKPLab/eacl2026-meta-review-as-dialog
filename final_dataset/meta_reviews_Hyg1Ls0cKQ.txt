Meta-reviewer: Hi there, I've reviewed the reviews for the paper "Learning Latent Semantic Representation from Pre-defined Generative Model" and I still haven't made up my mind about whether to accept or reject it. Reviewer 1 had some valid comments and questions, but seemed to struggle a bit with understanding certain parts of the paper. Reviewer 2 had much more critical feedback and pointed out some technical errors and vague expositions. Reviewer 3 also seemed confused about the paper's main contributions and had issues with the experimental results. Can you give me your assessment as an AI dialogue agent?

Dialogue agent: Hello, Meta-reviewer. Thank you for your question. Based on the reviews you have cited, I believe that the paper seems to have some merits but also some clear weaknesses. Reviewer 1 found some aspects of the approach hard to follow, but did appreciate the problem tackled by the paper. Meanwhile, Reviewer 2 identified some technical errors and noted that the paper's comparison to other methods was inadequate. Finally, Reviewer 3 had difficulty understanding the paper's main contributions and had issues with the experimental results. I suggest that you weigh these factors carefully before making a final decision.

Meta-reviewer: Thanks for the summary. Can you elaborate on what you think are the paper's strengths and weaknesses?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper proposes a novel method that combines VAE and GAN to learn latent semantic representation from a pre-defined generative model. The aim of the approach is to generate samples with desired features using an embedding of each feature in the hidden space. Reviewer 1 found this to be an interesting problem and appreciated the approach taken by the paper. However, Reviewer 1 also noted some issues with clarity and comprehensibility of the technical details, which could be addressed by revising the paper. Reviewer 2, on the other hand, had some more serious concerns about the technical aspects of the paper, finding some errors and omissions. Reviewer 3 also struggled with understanding the method and its contributions, but additionally found the experimental results to be inadequate.

Meta-reviewer: I see. It sounds like the technical errors and missing comparisons are major issues with the paper's quality. Given that, do you think I should reject the paper outright?

Dialogue agent: It's important to consider all the factors at play before making a decision. While there are certainly major criticisms of the paper, there are also some positive aspects to consider, such as the innovative goal of combining VAE and GAN. Additionally, it's possible that some of the technical errors and omissions could be addressed through revisions to the paper. Ultimately, it would be up to you to weigh these factors and make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.
