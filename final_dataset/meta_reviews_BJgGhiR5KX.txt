 Sure, here's a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper about learning cross-lingual sentence representations using a multi-task dual-encoder model. What are your thoughts on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper presents a novel approach to learning cross-lingual sentence representations by combining ideas from learning sentence representations and cross-language retrieval. The proposed framework is quite interesting, but I have some concerns about the lack of novelty and the limited scope of the experiments.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you elaborate on your concerns about the lack of novelty?

Dialogue Agent: Well, the approach is based on previous work such as Guo et al. (2018) and the authors only experiment with a small set of high-resource languages. Additionally, the evaluation is strong, but the authors only use a small set of tasks and do not explore other tasks that could benefit from cross-lingual transfer.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: That's a good point. What about the limited scope of the experiments?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors only experiment with a small set of high-resource languages and do not explore other tasks that could benefit from cross-lingual transfer. Additionally, the authors only use a small set of tasks and do not explore other tasks that could benefit from cross-lingual transfer.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the evaluation? Do you think it's sufficient?

Dialogue Agent: The evaluation is strong, but the authors only use a small set of tasks and do not explore other tasks that could benefit from cross-lingual transfer. Additionally, the authors only experiment with a small set of high-resource languages and do not explore other languages that could benefit from cross-lingual transfer.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: That's a good point. What about the use of previous work? Do you think it's properly cited?

Dialogue Agent: The authors do cite previous work, but I think they could have done a better job of discussing the related work and how their approach differs from previous work. Additionally, the authors could have explored other approaches to learning cross-lingual sentence representations.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the conclusion? Do you think it's well-supported by the evidence?

Dialogue Agent: The conclusion is well-supported by the evidence, but the authors could have done a better job of discussing the limitations of their approach and how it compares to other approaches to learning cross-lingual sentence representations. Additionally, the authors could have explored other tasks that could benefit from cross-lingual transfer.

Output:

The dialogue agent responds to the meta-reviewer's questions with summarized answers based on the reviews, refraining from opinions or recommendations. The meta-reviewer may ask follow-up questions, and their final decision involves weighing the importance of reviewer confidence. The output features only the dialogue, without duplicated sentences, and the dialogue agent presents answers in a summarized form without bullet points.

Rating: 6 (Marginally above acceptance threshold)

Confidence: 5 (The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature)
