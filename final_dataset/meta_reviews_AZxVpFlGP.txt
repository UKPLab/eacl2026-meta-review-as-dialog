 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Towards Consistency in Adversarial Classification":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Towards Consistency in Adversarial Classification". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! This paper studies the problem of consistency and calibration in the setting of classification with an adversary that perturbs the inputs during inference. The authors highlight the critical difference in the consistency and calibration between the standard setting and the adversarial setting.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That's interesting. What are the authors' main findings?

Dialogue Agent: The authors show that the usual continuous loss functions like hinge loss and logistic loss are not consistent nor calibrated for the adversarial $0/1$-loss. They also propose shifted odd functions as candidates that are shown to fulfill certain theoretical properties.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors discuss the limitations of currently achievable results on consistency and the potential difficulties with and pathways towards consistent losses for the adversarial setting. They also mention the potential social harm of their work.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, I think I have a good understanding of the paper now. Can you summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The reviews are generally positive, with one reviewer stating that the paper is "technically flawless" and another reviewer mentioning that the gained results seem to have less impact on practical problems of adversarial attack and defense.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. Based on the reviews and your summaries, I think I can make a decision on the paper. Thank you for your help!

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with?
