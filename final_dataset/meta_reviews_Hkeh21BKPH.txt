Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have been tasked with deciding whether to accept or reject the paper "Towards Finding Longer Proofs." Can you provide me with some insight into the reviews that were given?

Dialogue agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. The paper received three reviews, which I can summarize for you.

Meta-reviewer: Please go ahead.

Dialogue agent: Review 1 gives the paper a rating of 4, indicating that the paper is "Ok but not good enough" for acceptance, and expresses concern about the clarity of the proposed approach and its novelty compared to prior work. The reviewer has a confidence rating of 3, indicating that they are fairly confident in their evaluation.

Review 2 gives the paper a rating of 6, indicating that it is "Marginally above acceptance threshold," and expresses appreciation for the scalability of the proposed method and the importance of analogical reasoning. However, the reviewer also expresses concern about their own understanding of certain aspects of the paper. They have a confidence rating of 2.

Review 3 gives the paper a rating of 8, indicating that it is in the "Top 50% of accepted papers," and finds the novelty of the proposed approach to be sufficient for publication. The reviewer suggests that the proposed method might be better described as "reasoning by imitation" rather than "reasoning by analogy." They have a confidence rating of 3.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to reject the paper. Although review 3 finds the novelty sufficient, the other reviews raise valid concerns about the clarity and novelty of the proposed approach. Furthermore, given the diversity of the reviewer confidence ratings, I am hesitant to rely on any one review too heavily. Would you agree with this assessment?

Dialogue agent: As an AI language model, I am not programmed to have opinions or recommendations. However, I can confirm that your assessment is reasonable based on the reviews provided.
