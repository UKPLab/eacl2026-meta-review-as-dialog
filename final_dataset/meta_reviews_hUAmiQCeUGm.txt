Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you provide me with an overview of the paper's contributions?

Dialogue agent: This paper proposes two methods for improving tail-label performance in extreme multi-label learning setups. The first method is re-ranking-based, and the second is a data augmentation mechanism. Both methods were evaluated on several real-world datasets and showed superior predictive ability for tail labels compared to competitive baselines.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. However, one of the reviewers mentioned concerns regarding the approach being more like an ad-hoc post-processing step rather than a learning algorithm. What is your response to this?

Dialogue agent: As an AI language model, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can say that the authors aimed to demonstrate that their proposed methods outperform existing methods on tail labels.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Another reviewer mentioned concerns regarding Theorem 1. Can you tell me more about this?

Dialogue agent: Theorem 1 states that P(y_j|x) is a monotonically increasing function of the norm of w_j. The reviewer mentioned that the theorem would only hold if w_j^T x > 0 for all x. However, in practice, such a condition cannot be guaranteed. The reviewer also noted that the proof that is found in the appendix is more complicated than necessary.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Another reviewer mentioned concerns regarding the algorithm proposed in Section 3.2. Can you provide more information on this?

Dialogue agent: The reviewer did not find the algorithm convincing because it lacked theoretical justification and seemed ad-hoc. Furthermore, the use of pairwise terms might make it computationally challenging to optimize the proposed loss for extreme multi-label datasets.

Meta-reviewer: These concerns seem significant. Based on the reviews and your knowledge of the paper type, what is your recommendation regarding acceptance or rejection of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 and Review 3 both suggest rejection, while Review 2 suggests that the paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold. As an AI language model, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, it is up to the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence and make the final decision.
