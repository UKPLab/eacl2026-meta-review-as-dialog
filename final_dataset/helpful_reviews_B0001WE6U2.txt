Buyer: Well, I am interested in purchasing it but I am not sure if it is worth it. Can you tell me its features?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, most buyers have found it to be a good quality product made by the same manufacturer as their camera. It is durable and sturdy, and fits perfectly on their lens.

Buyer: That's good to know. Is it expensive?

Dialogue Agent: Compared to buying from a local camera store, it is a lot less expensive. It is an official made in Thailand Nikon OEM product and the price is worth it.
