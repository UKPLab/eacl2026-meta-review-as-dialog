 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "OPEN: Orthogonal Propagation with Ego-Network Modeling":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there, I'm reviewing a paper titled "OPEN: Orthogonal Propagation with Ego-Network Modeling". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new method called OPEN, which stands for Orthogonal Propagation with Ego-Network Modeling. This method aims to address the issue of irrelevant propagation in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by modeling the relevance between propagations to one node using ego-network modeling and eigenvector decomposition.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the proposed method and how it differs from existing GNNs?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The proposed method, OPEN, views propagation as dimensionality reduction and uses eigenvector decomposition to infer the propagation weights. This approach encourages diversity and reduces the risk of overfitting. Additionally, the method is designed to be efficient and scalable, as most ego-networks are much smaller in size.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the main strengths and weaknesses of the paper, in your opinion?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has several strengths, including its novel design motivation, experimental results on real datasets, and the potential to address the issue of irrelevant propagation in GNNs. However, the paper also has some weaknesses, such as typos and grammar mistakes, and the need for more thorough discussions of novelty and societal impact.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your assessment. Based on your responses, I'm leaning towards accepting the paper, but I have some concerns about the weaknesses you mentioned. Can you provide any additional insights or recommendations?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! While the paper has some weaknesses, the proposed method has shown promising results in addressing the issue of irrelevant propagation in GNNs. Additionally, the paper's design motivation and potential impact on the field of GNNs make it a worthwhile contribution. However, the authors may need to address the weaknesses and provide more thorough discussions of novelty and societal impact to strengthen the paper.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on our conversation and the reviews, I have decided to accept the paper with a rating of 7: Accept. The paper's technical solidity, potential impact, and good evaluation outweigh the weaknesses.

Dialogue Agent: Great! I'm glad I could help. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
