Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you provide me with information about the paper "Toward Robust Spiking Neural Network Against Adversarial Perturbation"?

Dialogue agent: Sure, I'm happy to assist you. The paper proposes a linear relaxation method for spiking neural networks (SNNs) to improve their robustness against adversarial perturbation.

Meta-reviewer: What is the type of the paper?

Dialogue agent: The paper is categorized as long.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue agent: According to Review 1, the paper is well-written and proposes a linear relaxation scheme for SNNs. The paper also takes into account temporal and spatial updates, which is a strength. However, there are some concerns about the loose linear relaxation, the probabilistic upper and lower bounding strategies, and the coding used in the paper. Review 2 acknowledges the proposed methodology to tackle adversarial robustness in SNNs; however, it mentions the limited evaluation as a weakness. Finally, Review 3 praises the clear contributions and achieved results of the paper but suggests improvements in proofreading and clarity of some key sections.
