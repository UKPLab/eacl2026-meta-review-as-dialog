 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Algorithms that Approximate Data Removal: New Results and Limitations":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Algorithms that Approximate Data Removal: New Results and Limitations". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes an online approximate unlearning algorithm that is efficient in computation and memory. The algorithm is based on the infinitesimal jackknife and can handle non-smooth regularized models. It also provides theoretical proof of the generalization and deletion capacity of the proposed method.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the limitations of the proposed method?

Dialogue Agent: The paper identifies several limitations of the proposed method, including the need for careful hyperparameter tuning and the potential for errors in the deletion process. The authors also note that the proposed method may not be effective in all non-smooth regularized models.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the comparison of runtime in different hyperparameter settings? Is that discussed in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison of runtime in different hyperparameter settings. However, the authors do mention that the proposed method can exceed the retention time of the model and the second-order Taylor approximation.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, I understand. What about the use cases of the proposed algorithm? Are there any limitations or challenges in applying the method in real-world scenarios?

Dialogue Agent: The paper notes that the proposed method may not be suitable for all use cases, such as when the model is trained on a large dataset or when the data is highly imbalanced. The authors also suggest that the method may not be effective in all non-smooth regularized models.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews, do you think the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would recommend that the paper be accepted with a confidence level of 5. The paper provides sufficient theoretical proof of the proposed method and exhibits reasonable improvement over existing work. However, the paper does have some limitations and challenges that are noted in the reviews.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. I will consider your recommendations when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
