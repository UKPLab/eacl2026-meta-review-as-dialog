 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm evaluating a paper for acceptance and I have some questions about the reviews. Can you help me?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I have access to the reviews and can provide summarized answers based on the reviews. What questions do you have?

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: Great! Let me start by asking about the novelty of the paper. Review 1 states that the paper lacks proper positioning within the space of knowledge distillation and student-teacher training. Can you provide any insights on this?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper does not offer any new insights about how to choose the best student network or which transferral dataset to use. The introduction refers to the lack of novelty in the approach, and Review 1 suggests that the paper seems to be lacking proper positioning within the space of knowledge distillation and student-teacher training.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. What about the experimental results? Review 2 states that the experiments do not contribute any new insights about how to choose the best student network or which transferral dataset to use. Can you provide any insights on this?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the experiments do not offer any new insights about how to choose the best student network or which transferral dataset to use. Review 2 suggests that the experiments do not contribute any new insights, and Review 1 states that the paper seems to be lacking proper positioning within the space of knowledge distillation and student-teacher training.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the theoretical or intuitive justification for why the authors would want to perform knowledge transfer using unrelated data? Review 2 states that the authors should provide a theoretical or intuitive justification for this approach. Can you provide any insights on this?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the authors do not provide a theoretical or intuitive justification for why they would want to perform knowledge transfer using unrelated data. Review 2 states that the authors should provide a theoretical or intuitive justification for this approach, and Review 1 suggests that the paper seems to be lacking proper positioning within the space of knowledge distillation and student-teacher training.

Turn 5:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help! Based on the reviews, I think I have a good understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. Can you provide any final thoughts or recommendations?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper lacks proper positioning within the space of knowledge distillation and student-teacher training, and the experiments do not offer any new insights about how to choose the best student network or which transferral dataset to use. Additionally, the authors do not provide a theoretical or intuitive justification for why they would want to perform knowledge transfer using unrelated data. These factors may influence the decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.
