 Sure! Here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper about Recurrent Experience Replay in Distributed Reinforcement Learning. Can you summarize the main findings and contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper investigates the use of recurrent neural networks in distributed reinforcement learning settings, and proposes a new algorithm called R2DR that leverages experience replay to improve agent generalization. The authors evaluate their approach on the Atari and DMLab benchmarks, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main criticisms and limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers raise some concerns about the lack of a more thorough theoretical analysis supporting the empirical findings, and the fact that the authors do not provide enough details about some "informal" experiments. Additionally, the reviewers suggest that the authors should have considered other metrics to evaluate the ability of the methods on common aspects.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you summarize the reviewer ratings and confidence?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The reviewers rate the paper as "Good paper, accept" with a confidence of 4, indicating that they are confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews, do you think the paper is acceptable?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, based on the reviews, the paper is acceptable. The reviewers acknowledge the paper's contributions and findings, but raise some concerns about the lack of a more thorough theoretical analysis and the need for more details about certain experiments. However, the reviewers' ratings and confidence suggest that the paper is of high quality and the evaluation is correct.
