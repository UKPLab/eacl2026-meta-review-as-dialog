Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you provide me with some more information about the paper "Learning with Random Learning Rates"?

Dialogue agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. What specific information would you like me to provide?

Meta-reviewer: Can you summarize the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Sure. The paper proposes a method called "All Learning Rates At Once" (Alrao) which assigns a random learning rate to each neuron in a neural network while training. This eliminates the need for tuning a fixed learning rate for each neuron and can lead to better performance. The paper also provides experimental evidence that Alrao performs comparably to stochastic gradient descent with an optimal learning rate and is more stable than Adam. However, the paper does not provide any theoretical analysis of the method.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Can you tell me more about the reviews of the paper?

Dialogue agent: The paper received three reviews. Review 1 described the proposed method as novel and easy to implement. Reviewer 1 also noted that the paper is well-written and the experiments are solid, but pointed out some concerns regarding the lack of theoretical convergence analysis, unclear experimental settings, and limited support for the proposed method compared to other optimization methods. Review 2 criticized the paper for not providing enough evidence to support the effectiveness of the proposed method and suggested adding more experiments comparing Alrao to sampling learning rates per weight. Review 3 also raised concerns about the experimental evaluation of the method, but noted that the paper is well-written and organized.

Meta-reviewer: Based on these reviews, how confident are the reviewers in their evaluations?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 expressed confidence in their evaluation, but was only marginally above the acceptance threshold. Review 2 expressed confidence in their evaluation, but rated the paper as ok but not good enough for acceptance. Review 3 was marginally below the acceptance threshold but expressed confidence in their evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on this information, I will need to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the paper and make a decision on whether to accept or reject it.
