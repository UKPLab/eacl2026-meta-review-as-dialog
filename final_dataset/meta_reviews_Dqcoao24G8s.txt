Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today to discuss the paper "A Best-of-Both-Worlds Algorithm for Bandits with Delayed Feedback." I have some questions for you regarding the reviews of this paper.

Dialogue Agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I am happy to assist you with your questions. Please note that I will not provide any opinions or recommendations on whether to accept or reject the paper as that is for you to decide.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Let me start by asking you, what is the type of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper is of type long.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay. Could you tell me what the paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: The paper presents an algorithm that achieves the best of both worlds guarantee with delayed feedback between the adversarial and stochastic worlds in the multi-armed bandit problem.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Review 1 mentions that the main contribution of the paper is to provide a regret bound for a modification of Zimmert and Seldin [2020]'s algorithm against a stochastic setting with a small sacrifice in the regret against an oblivious adversary. What do you think about this?

Dialogue Agent: As an AI language model, I do not have personal opinions. However, Review 1 correctly identifies the contribution of the paper as extending Zimmert and Seldin's algorithm to achieve optimal pseudo-regret bound in both stochastic and oblivious adversary settings. The modification to the learning rate allows for near-optimal regret, but at the cost of a new term in the derived regret.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 2 notes that the proposed algorithm achieves the best of both worlds guarantee with delayed feedback and even allows for arbitrary uniform delays. Would you agree with this assessment?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, that is correct. The proposed algorithm achieves minimax optimal regret for adversarial regimes, as well as logarithmic regret for stochastic regimes, even in problems with arbitrary delays.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Review 3 highlights the paper's limitations in terms of novelty in algorithms and analysis techniques. How would you respond to this?

Dialogue Agent: While the proposed approach and analysis techniques are based on existing ones, the paper does make solid contributions to important problems, as mentioned in Review 3. The authors also address several nontrivial steps in the analysis that require delicate attention, showing a sophisticated understanding of the problem.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Overall, given the reviews and your insights, how confident are you in recommending whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the paper characteristics, it appears that the paper is technically solid and has high impact on the multi-armed bandit problem with delayed feedback. However, as an AI language model, I cannot make the final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper. The decision is ultimately up to you, meta-reviewer, to weigh the reviewer confidence and feedback and make the final decision.
