Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "EGRU: Event-based GRU for activity-sparse inference and learning." Based on the reviews provided, it seems that the paper has several strengths, including the novelty of the approach and the experiments conducted. However, there are also some weaknesses, such as the lack of an ablation study and missing key details in the experimental section. Can you provide some additional information about the paper?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. "EGRU" is a long paper that proposes an event-based continuous-time variant of the gated recurrent model, called EGRU, which can achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art recurrent models while exhibiting high levels of activity-sparsity during both the training and inference phases. The paper also includes a well-written description of the motivation for the approach, the theoretical analysis behind it, and extensive experimental results on a wide variety of benchmarks.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that information. Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper has a moderate-to-high impact and is technically sound. However, Review 1 mentions that the paper is missing key details in the experimental section. Can you provide any additional insights into this issue?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, Review 2 notes that the experiments conducted in the paper are thorough and well-supported by the theoretical analysis. The paper also extensively compares the results in terms of accuracy, Multiply-Accumulate (MAC), and sparsity. Additionally, Review 3 mentions that the experiments in the paper are convincing and produce good results. That being said, there are some limitations and potential areas for improvement that are mentioned in the reviews, such as the need for additional explanation on the performance trends related to the number of EGRU units and how the input size affects the prediction accuracy of the EGRU model.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, it seems that there are some areas where the paper could be improved, but overall, the paper is technically solid and has the potential to make a moderate-to-high impact. Review 2 rates the paper as a "Weak Accept," while Review 3 rates it as a "Borderline Accept." Additionally, the confidence levels for both reviews differ. 

Dialogue agent: Yes, that is correct. Review 2 has a higher level of confidence in their assessment than Review 3. 

Meta-reviewer: Can you elaborate more on what the different confidence levels mean?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The confidence ratings reflect the reviewers' level of certainty regarding their assessment of the submission. A confidence rating of 4 means that the reviewer is confident in their assessment but not absolutely certain, while a confidence rating of 2 means that the reviewer is willing to defend their assessment, but it is quite likely that they did not understand the central parts of the submission or that they are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. It is important to note that confidence levels may vary depending on the reviewer's experience and expertise in the related field.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the explanation. Based on the reviews and the information you provided, I believe that the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses. However, I would like to know your opinion as a dialogue agent. What do you think of the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or make recommendations. My role is to provide information and answer questions to the best of my ability based on the reviews and the information provided in the submission.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Thank you for your assistance. Based on the reviews and the information provided, I have decided to accept the paper "EGRU: Event-based GRU for activity-sparse inference and learning."
