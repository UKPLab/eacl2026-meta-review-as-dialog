 Sure, here is a dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper on exploring the interpretability of LSTM neural networks over multi-variable data:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper on exploring the interpretability of LSTM neural networks over multi-variable data. Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors propose a new approach called IMV-LSTM, which uses tensorized hidden states and an update scheme to learn the hidden states. They also develop a mixture attention mechanism and a summarization method to quantify the temporal and variable importance in the data. The paper explores the interpretability of LSTM with multivariate data obtained from various and disparate applications.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the authors' main findings?

Dialogue Agent: The authors show that their approach outperforms popular interpretable models on three different datasets, and the experiments regarding the variable importance are convincing. They also find that the proposed method is more accurate than the baseline models.

Meta-reviewer: That's great. What are the limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: One limitation is that the authors use a simple normalized summation function for the aggregation of the hidden states, which may not be the best choice. Additionally, the authors do not provide a thorough evaluation of the computational complexity of their approach.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What are the reviewer's comments and ratings?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers have mixed opinions about the paper. One reviewer praises the paper's contributions and findings, while another reviewer raises concerns about the choice of the aggregation function and the computational complexity of the approach. The ratings range from 5 to 7, with an average rating of around 6.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. I think I have a good understanding of the paper now.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.
