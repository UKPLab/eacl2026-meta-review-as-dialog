Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper titled "From Nodes to Networks: Evolving Recurrent Neural Networks". Could you tell me more about the paper type?

Dialogue agent: Of course, the paper is categorized as long.

Meta-reviewer: Great, thank you. Review 1 mentioned that the experiments were not compared against the latest architectures and best results. What do you have to add to that?

Dialogue agent: I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations. However, I can confirm that the review mentions a lack of comparison with the latest architectures, and that the potential benefit of the work is hard to evaluate without a clear abolition study for the Meta-LSTM idea.

Meta-reviewer: I see, the reviewer also mentioned that there are many typos and missing references in the paper. Can you confirm this?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the review mentions this as a concern.

Meta-reviewer: And what about Review 2? They mentioned that this paper requires more comparisons and analysis. Can you tell me what type of experiments and comparisons they are referring to?

Dialogue agent: The review specifically asks for an analysis comparing a new finding of the LSTM architecture to the classic LSTM and NAS. Additionally, they suggest more experiments on larger datasets such as Wikitext-2 and a comparison with other architecture search methods.

Meta-reviewer: Finally, Review 3 mentions multiple concerns with the paper. Could you summarize those for me?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 acknowledges the use of an interesting method - tree-based genetic programming - but argues that prior work has also applied GP to evolving RNN topologies. Additionally, they believe the comparison to NAS is unfair as the max depth of NAS is not in principle limited to 10. They believe the second contribution of allowing heterogeneity in the layers of the network is rather minimal. Lastly, they argue that the paper requires more fair comparisons with other methods and that the problem with generalization is not specific to GP but to ML methods in general.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing that. Based on the reviews and the type of paper, what is your recommendation?

Dialogue agent: As per my capabilities, I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations. However, I can inform you that the reviews suggest the paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold and that two reviews suggest rejection with confidence scores of 4.
