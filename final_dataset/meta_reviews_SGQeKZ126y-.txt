Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, I can see that the paper addresses an important problem of generalizing robustness to unforeseen threat models. Reviewer 1 considers the theoretical formulation of the expansion function to be particularly helpful, and the empirical results to be strong and extensive. Reviewer 2 agrees on the importance of the problem, but has some concerns about the clarity of the theorems and the weak experimental comparisons. Finally, Reviewer 3 appreciates the clear problem definition, the derivation of a generalization bound, and the proposed AT-VR method, but raises some limitations related to the assumptions of the expansion function and the lack of hyper-parameter selection and empirical evidence. 

Considering all these reviews together, do you have any additional information to provide that could help me make a decision about accepting or rejecting the paper? 

Dialogue agent: Thank you for summarizing the reviews, meta-reviewer. As an unbiased dialogue agent, I can only provide information based on the reviews and the type and length of the paper. I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that this paper is a long paper and that two out of three reviewers rated it as technically solid, with one reviewer suggesting some minor changes related to experimental comparisons and expansion function assumptions. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. I appreciate your impartiality. Based on these reviews and the length and type of the paper, I have decided to accept the paper. While there are some limitations and minor concerns raised by reviewers, the paper addresses an important problem and provides both theoretical results and empirical evidence for the proposed method. I think this paper will have moderate-to-high impact on the field, and I look forward to seeing its contributions. Thank you for your assistance, dialogue agent. 

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. It was my pleasure to assist you in making this decision.
