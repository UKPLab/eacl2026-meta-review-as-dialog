 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "The Cakewalk Method":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper titled "The Cakewalk Method" and I'd like to ask some questions about it. Can you help me?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I have access to the reviews and the paper's type (long). Please go ahead and ask your questions.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: Great! So, the first review states that the paper proposes an approach to construct surrogate objectives for the effective application of policy gradient methods to combinatorial optimization without known neighborhood structure. The surrogate is constructed with the goal of reducing the need of hyper-parameter tuning and evaluated on a clique finding task. What are the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper proposes a method called Cakewalk, which is a surrogate reward function that mitigates the variance in the reward, and hence the update size, in policy gradient methods for combinatorial optimization problems. The method is based on a surrogate reward function that is constructed using the CDF of the reward distribution.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. The review also states that the proposed approach is very similar to the CE method by Rubinstein, and that the authors should have discussed this relationship more thoroughly. Can you tell me more about the relationship between Cakewalk and CE?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Cakewalk is closely related to the cross-entropy method (CE). Both methods approximate the reward CDF from K samples and use this to construct a surrogate reward. The difference is that Cakewalk uses the CDF directly, while CE uses a threshold function on the CDF.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful to know. The review also mentions that the distribution proposed in section 3.2 assumes independence between the elements $x_j$. Is this a valid assumption?

Dialogue Agent: The assumption of independence between the elements $x_j$ in the sampling distribution (Section 3.2) may not be valid for some relatively simple problems. For example, consider $x$ a binary vector and reward equal to the parity $S(x) = \sum{x_j} % 2$.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Another concern is that the experiments use the same set of (untuned) hyperparameters for each method. How were the hyperparameters chosen?

Dialogue Agent: The hyperparameters (learning rate, AdaGrad $\delta$, Adam $\beta_1, \beta_2$) were chosen using a combination of literature review and experimentation. However, it would be better to tune these values for each method independently.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. One final question - the review states that the paper would benefit from experimental results on more than one problem. Can you tell me if the authors have any plans to expand their experiments to other problems?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors discuss their results on k-medoids in the appendices, but it seems like these results aren't quite complete yet. They plan to expand their experiments to other problems in future work.

Output:

Based on the reviews and the paper's type, the meta-reviewer may accept or reject the paper. The final decision involves weighing the importance of reviewer confidence in the paper's contributions and validity. The dialogue agent provides summarized answers based on the reviews, refraining from opinions or recommendations. The output should feature only the dialogue, without duplicated sentences, and the dialogue agent should present answers in a summarized form without bullet points.
