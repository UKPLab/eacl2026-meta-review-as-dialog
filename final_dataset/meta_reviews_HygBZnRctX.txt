Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I've been assigned to oversee the review process for the paper "Transferring Knowledge across Learning Processes." I see that the paper received three reviews, with ratings of 6, 8, and 8. Can you give me a summary of the reviews and your thoughts on whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, certainly. Review 1 gave a rating of 6 and expressed some concerns about missing experiment details, the need for more thorough baselines, and the use of different datasets for comparison. Review 2 also gave a rating of 8 but had several theoretical concerns with the proposed Leap approach, including the use of the Jacobian matrix and the regularization term. Finally, Review 3 gave a rating of 8 and liked the novelty of the approach and the experimental evidence, but had some critiques of the mathematical definitions and experimental details.

Based on these reviews, I'm confident that the paper is at least marginally above the acceptance threshold. While there are some concerns about missing details and theoretical foundations, the main idea of the paper seems promising, and the experimental evidence is sufficient. I would recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to address the reviewers' concerns. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the overview. Can you give me some more specific examples of the missing details and theoretical concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, certainly. For example, Review 1 pointed out that some experiment details were missing, such as parameter configurations and the use of state-of-the-art baselines. Review 2 had several theoretical concerns, including the use of the identity matrix instead of the Jacobian matrix and the need for a better motivation of the regularization term. Review 3 also had some critiques of the mathematical definitions and experimental details, including the lack of clarity around the set Theta and the need for more information about the "Finetuning" approach in Table 1.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for clarifying those issues. It sounds like the paper could benefit from more thorough experimentation and theoretical explanations. Can you give me your thoughts on the confidence levels of the reviewers' evaluations?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Review 1 and Review 3 seemed fairly confident in their evaluations, with confidence ratings of 4 and 3, respectively. Review 2 did not give a confidence rating, but the tone of the review suggested a relatively high level of uncertainty. Overall, I would say that the reviewers' confidence levels were moderate to high, but there were some areas of uncertainty around the theoretical foundations of the approach and the missing experiment details.
