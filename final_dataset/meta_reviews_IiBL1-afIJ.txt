Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper titled "Immersive Visualization of the Classical Non-Euclidean Spaces using Real-Time Ray Tracing in VR." Can you tell me more about the type of the paper and the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper is classified as long, and the reviews raise concerns regarding the technical novelty of the paper. Review 1 questions the contribution of the paper and suggests that it might not be enough to justify publication in a computer graphics conference without exploring new applications or conducting user evaluations. Review 2 appreciates the changes made to the paper, but notes that the lack of technical novelty remains an issue. It recommends exploring novel applications arising from the implementation and conducting user evaluation to address the issue. Review 3 highlights the paper's contribution to exploring visualization of non-Euclidean spaces in VR using RTX GPUs. It also suggests some improvements to the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Do you think the reviews are conflicting or pointing towards a specific recommendation for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The reviews show some degree of overlap in their concerns about technical novelty, but they do not conflict with each other. Review 1 and Review 2 suggest that the lack of technical contribution might not meet the standards of a computer graphics conference, while Review 3 recommends acceptance after some more polish.

Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews, what is your recommendation for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent and not a reviewer, I cannot provide a recommendation for the paper. However, I can provide information to help you make a decision as a meta-reviewer. The reviews suggest that the technical contribution of the paper might be limited and might benefit from addressing concerns about user evaluation and exploring novel applications. Moreover, the confidence of the reviewers varies. Review 1 and Review 2 are confident but not absolutely certain that the paper falls below the acceptance threshold, while Review 3 is fairly confident that the paper is good enough for acceptance after some more polish.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I have decided to accept the paper conditionally. I recommend that the authors address the concerns about technical novelty, conduct user evaluations, and explore novel applications arising from the implementation to strengthen the paper. I also suggest that the authors revise the paper based on the minor points raised by the reviewers regarding the abstract, the paper structure, the use of terminology, and some missing details.
