 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "GStarX: Explaining Graph Neural Networks with Structure-Aware Cooperative Games":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper titled "GStarX: Explaining Graph Neural Networks with Structure-Aware Cooperative Games". Can you tell me what this paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new method for explaining the decisions of graph neural networks (GNNs) called GStarX. It uses a structure-aware scoring function called HN value, which is based on cooperative game theory.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the HN value and how it is used to explain GNN decisions?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The HN value is a scoring function that takes into account the graph structure information to compute the importance of each node in the graph. The GStarX algorithm uses the HN value to generate explanations for GNN decisions.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the paper has several strengths, including its technical solidity, high impact on at least one sub-area, and good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, and reproducibility. However, one of the weaknesses is that the proposed method can only be applied to find node importances, ignoring the differing feature importances. Additionally, there is a limitation in not being able to compute feature explanations directly, which might be important in some real-world datasets and applications.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the strengths and weaknesses you've just mentioned, what is your assessment of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as 7: Accept, with high impact on at least one sub-area, or moderate-to-high impact on more than one areas, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations. However, I would also note that the paper has some limitations, such as the lack of technical originality and the inability to compute feature explanations directly.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. Do you have any further insights or recommendations for the authors?

Dialogue Agent: One recommendation for the authors would be to address the limitation of not being able to compute feature explanations directly. Perhaps they could explore alternative methods for generating feature explanations or provide additional evaluation metrics to account for the lack of feature explanations. Additionally, the authors might consider expanding their discussion of the related work to provide more context for their contributions.
