Buyer: Hello, can you tell me more about the EARBUDi clips and how they work with Apple earbuds?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the EARBUDi clips attach to Apple earbuds and turn them into sport headphones with a soft over-the-ear design. They provide a custom, comfortable fit with earbud tilt and rotation. These clips are adjustable like a ball joint, making it possible to wear them while walking or running.

Buyer: That sounds interesting. Do they work well? Do they stay on while running?

Dialogue Agent: According to a few positive reviews, these clips work great and take about 3 seconds to adjust. They fit well on the Apple earbuds, and the earbuds stay in place. One reviewer said that they can move around and they don't fall out. They are also very easy to put on and take off.

Buyer: Okay. Do they interfere with the sound quality?

Dialogue Agent: Most customers haven't mentioned any interference with sound quality. Actually, a few reviews state that the earbud mechanism is positioned farther away from the ears, which is better for sound quality.

Buyer: Great. That's helpful. One concern I have is that they might fall off easily. Have customers mentioned anything about the durability of the clips?

Dialogue Agent: A few reviews mention issues with durability. Some customers have had issues with the plastic clips breaking within a week, but others have used these clips regularly for more than a year, and the clips still work great. 

Buyer: I see. So, would you recommend them?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I can not give a recommendation or opinion, but based on the reviews I presented to you, most reviewers are quite satisfied with the product. 

Buyer: Thank you for your help. After considering the reviews, I think I will give them a try and purchase a pair.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, happy customers is our priority. Please let us know if you need any further assistance.
