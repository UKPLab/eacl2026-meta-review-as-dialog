Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. Overall, it seems that the paper has some interesting contributions and solid experimental results. However, Reviewer 1 raised some concerns about the conceptual novelty and experimental comparison to prior work, and also highlighted some limitations of the MILP solver used. Can the dialogue agent provide more information on these issues?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. The paper does propose some novel enhancements to MILP formulations for neural network verification, specifically the progressive bound tightening approach. While asymmetric bounds and novel branch-and-bound strategies have been studied before, the authors show the benefits of combining these with the progressive bound tightening approach. As for the experimental comparisons, the authors do compare their approach to prior work on verification and adversarial attacks, and show that their approach achieves favorable results on several architectures and datasets. However, as Reviewer 1 pointed out, there are some recent approaches that achieve better verified adversarial error rates, and it would be interesting to see how the proposed approach compares to those. Regarding the MILP solver, the authors do mention the use of Gurobi in their experiments, but they also describe how their approach can work with other MILP solvers.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Reviewer 2 seems quite positive about the paper, while Reviewer 3 also finds it to be a valuable contribution. How would you rate the confidence levels of these reviews, considering the relevant literature and potential limitations of the approach?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2 seems very familiar with the relevant literature and mentions that the paper makes a solid contribution to the field. Their confidence level is high, indicating that they are absolutely certain about their evaluation. Reviewer 3 also expresses a positive view of the paper and finds it valuable. However, their confidence level is lower, indicating that their evaluation is an educated guess. While both reviewers have positive assessments, it is important to consider potential limitations of the approach and the need for further comparison to recent state-of-the-art methods.
