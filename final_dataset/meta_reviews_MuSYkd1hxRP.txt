Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Geometry-Aware Gradient Algorithms for Neural Architecture Search". Can you give me a brief summary of what the paper is about and its contribution?

Dialogue agent: Of course, the paper proposes a modification to the DARTS algorithm for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by using exponentiated gradient descent to update the architecture parameters. This modification is motivated by theoretical considerations that favor sparse values of the parameters and help decrease the gap between discrete architectures and their continuous relaxations. The authors also provide empirical results on three benchmark tasks that show the effectiveness of their method.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Review 1 provides a mixed review with some pros and cons of the paper. Can you tell me more about the concerns raised in the review?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 raises some concerns about the use of exponentiated gradient (EG) to update the architecture parameters, as it is not clear how it improves the NAS performance. The reviewer also questions the efficiency claimed by the paper, as it is only shown in Table 2. Review 1 also suggests adding a conclusion section to the paper and explains the lines with deeper colors in Figure 2.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 2 seems to be very positive about the paper and recommends accepting it. Can you explain what the strengths of the paper are according to Review 2?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 highlights the strengths of the paper, such as the easy applicability of the proposed method to existing NAS methods, the theoretical support for the proposed modification with convergence guarantees, the extensive empirical experiments on multiple benchmark tasks, and the reproducible code included in the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Finally, Review 3 provides a detailed analysis of the paper's experimental evaluation and the presentation of the results. Can you give me a summary of the main points raised in the review?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 presents a mixed review of the paper's experimental evaluation, raising concerns about the novelty of the proposed modification, the unclear presentation of theoretical results, and the limited quality improvements on most benchmark tasks. However, the reviewer also acknowledges the strong empirical results on NASBench-201 and praises the direct comparisons between modified and non-modified NAS algorithms. Review 3 also suggests improving the clarity of the paper, particularly in the presentation of the theoretical results, the organization of the results in Table 1, and the interpretation of Figure 2.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the detailed summary. Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper has some strengths and weaknesses. How confident are you that the overall evaluation of the paper is correct?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, I would say that the overall evaluation of the paper is positive but with some concerns and suggestions for improvement. Review 2 recommends clear acceptance, which indicates high confidence in the paper's quality, but Review 1 and 3 raise some concerns that should be addressed. Overall, I would say that the confidence of the reviewers is moderate, with some caveats about the novelty and clarity of the paper.
