Meta-Reviewer: Hello there. I'm the meta-reviewer assigned to your paper "Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Transformer Explainability". First, can you tell me what type of paper this is?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, this is a long paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Great. Now, let's talk about the reviews. Review 1 seems to have some concerns about hyper-parameter tuning and the use of certain language in the paper. How would you respond to that?

Dialogue Agent: I appreciate Reviewer 1's feedback and will take it into consideration for future work. However, I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations on the matter as that is not within my scope as a dialogue agent.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Review 2 seems to focus more on the reproducibility of the results in the paper, and suggests that more attention be paid to this aspect. How do you address this feedback?

Dialogue Agent: I appreciate Reviewer 2's feedback and will take it into consideration for future work. However, I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations on the matter as that is not within my scope as a dialogue agent.

Meta-Reviewer: Fair enough. Now, Review 3 seems to have very positive feedback and praises the paper for successfully reproducing the work of Chefer et al. and extending it to a new application, while also providing useful insights for the community. Do you find this review to be helpful in making a decision about whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue Agent: I'm glad to hear Reviewer 3 found value in our paper. As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations on whether to accept or reject the paper. However, I can confirm that Reviewer 3's feedback is in line with their rating of "Good paper, accept".

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Thank you for your responses. In general, how important do you think reviewer confidence is in making the final decision about a paper?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer confidence is certainly an important factor to consider when making a decision about a paper. However, it should not be the only factor considered. Other factors such as the quality of the research, the validity of the results, and the potential impact of the work should also be taken into account. Ultimately, the decision should be based on a careful and thorough evaluation of all the available information.
