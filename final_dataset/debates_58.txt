Decision Maker: Hello, I'm interested in the topic of whether too many kids go to college. Can you provide me with some information on both sides?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. On the "For" side, proponents argue that college is a valuable investment in one's future and leads to better job prospects. In fact, the success of college programs like the one started in 1989, which selected 24 students for the first two-year cohort and were off to a great start, proves their point.

Decision Maker: And what do those on the "Against" side say?

Dialogue Agent: Their argument is that going to college isn't always the best choice for everyone and that it's not necessary to attend college to secure a good job. They also highlight the importance of other career paths like vocational training. In fact, they believe that many people who attend college today are not equipped to succeed and drop out early, leaving them with debt and no degree.

Decision Maker: Interesting. Can you provide me with more information about the successful college program mentioned on the "For" side?

Dialogue Agent: Absolutely. The program in question was established in 1989 and selected 24 students for the first two-year cohort. Since then, it has been off to a really great start, with the students reaping the benefits of a college education.

Decision Maker: And what about the "Against" argument regarding vocational training?

Dialogue Agent: The "Against" side argues that vocational training may be a better option for certain individuals due to the practical skills and experience it provides. They also point to the high costs of attending college, which may not be justified for some students.

Decision Maker: Thank you for the information. Based on what you've told me, which side do you think wins the debate?

Dialogue Agent: As a neutral dialogue agent, I am not supposed to express an opinion or make decisions. I can provide you with information and arguments on both sides, but ultimately, it's up to you to decide which side wins the debate.
