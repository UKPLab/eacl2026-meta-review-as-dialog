Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Hierarchical classification at multiple operating points" and I need to make a decision on whether to accept or reject it. Can you provide me with more information on the paper's contributions and how it compares to previous work in the field?

Dialogue agent: Certainly! The paper proposes a new approach for evaluating hierarchical classifiers for predicting non-leaf nodes at multiple operating points. It introduces a new evaluation metric based on operating characteristic curves and compares the performance of different loss functions, including two new ones proposed by the authors. The experiments are conducted on ImageNet and iNat datasets and the paper provides conclusive insights into the performance of different classifiers. In terms of how it compares to previous work, the paper discusses a large amount of literature and adequately summaries the comparison between the paper's and previous methods.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. One of the reviews mentioned that the significance of comparing hierarchical classifiers at multiple operating points seems to be understated. Can you clarify whether the paper has properly addressed this issue?

Dialogue agent: The paper discusses the importance of evaluating hierarchical classifiers at multiple operating points and it provides a valuable evaluation of the problem. However, one of the reviewers pointed out that the authors could improve the significance of their work by explaining why evaluation at multiple operating points is not popular or feasible without their method.

Meta-reviewer: That's a valid concern. What about the technical aspects of the paper? Are there any particular issues that I should be aware of?

Dialogue agent: The reviews indicate that the paper is technically solid, with no major concerns regarding evaluation, resources, reproducibility, or ethical considerations. One of the reviews suggested that the clarity of the key methods may have room for improvement, and the authors could elaborate more on certain equations and algorithms. However, the other reviewers did not share the same concern.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, thank you for the information. What are the reviewers' overall assessments?

Dialogue agent: The reviewers rated the paper as a weak accept, with a score of 6, which indicates a technically solid, moderate-to-high impact paper, with no major concerns. However, the reviewers also indicated a confidence score of 3, which means they are fairly confident in their assessments, but it is possible that they did not understand some parts of the paper or they are unfamiliar with some related work.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Is there any consensus on the potential negative societal impact of the paper?

Dialogue agent: None of the reviewers mentioned any concerns regarding potential negative societal impact.
