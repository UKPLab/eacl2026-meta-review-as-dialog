Meta-reviewer: Hello there, dialogue agent. I am reviewing the paper "Critical Learning Periods in Deep Networks" and I have some questions about the reviews before I make a decision on acceptance. Can you confirm the paper type for me?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the type of the paper is long.

Meta-reviewer: Great, thank you. I have read through the three reviews provided. Review 1 seems to have a positive outlook on the paper, but it also mentions some skepticism towards comparing artificial neural networks with biological neural networks. What is your take on that?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I can only provide information based on the reviews and the paper itself, without providing opinions or recommendations. However, I can confirm that Review 1 did mention the comparison and expressed some skepticism but ultimately gave a strong accept rating for the quality of the experiments and the well-written paper.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Moving on, Review 2 mentions the importance of critical periods in biological neural systems and the authors' successful parallelism between such periods and deep neural networks. However, the reviewer also has some detailed questions about the authors' methodology. Could you summarize these questions for me?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 provides several detailed questions for clarification. One question is about early training on blurred images and whether it prevents the initial convolution filters from learning to discriminate high-frequency components. The reviewer also wonders if freezing the last layers and only maintaining plasticity in the lower ones could be a way of "reopening" the critical period. Additionally, Review 2 asks about the effect of changing the optimizer on the presence of the critical period, the potential impact of standard regularization methods, and whether the authors' results are compatible with the maturation of inhibition in neuroscience.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing those questions. Lastly, Review 3 found the paper interesting but mentions some disappointment in the lack of theoretical contributions and an incomplete analysis of the ubiquity of the empirical findings. Could you elaborate on that?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 found the paper interesting due to the empirical simulation experiments presented, but noted a lack of theoretical contributions and analysis of the ubiquity of the findings. Additionally, the reviewer suggests that the paper could benefit from an analysis of a simpler toy model. However, Review 3 gave a marginal acceptance rating, indicating that the paper's quality is barely above the acceptance threshold.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for clarifying the reviews for me, dialogue agent. I will take all of them into consideration before making a decision on acceptance.
