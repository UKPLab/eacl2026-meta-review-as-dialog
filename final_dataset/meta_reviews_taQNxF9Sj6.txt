 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper, titled "Adding Recurrence to Pretrained Transformers":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Adding Recurrence to Pretrained Transformers". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes adding recurrence to pretrained transformers, which enables the model to work on longer sequences and reduces memory usage. The authors evaluate the model on two language modeling datasets and show that it outperforms baseline models.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the reviewer's opinions on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Reviewer 1 finds the paper's technique to be practical and useful, but has some questions about the article, particularly regarding the relationship between the overlap length and improvement using the recurrent connection. Reviewer 2 votes for accepting the paper, highlighting the model's ability to work on longer sequences and reduce memory usage. Reviewer 3 is concerned about the limited evaluation and the need for human evaluation of the generated outputs.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, according to the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers agree that the paper's main contributions are the introduction of recurrence to pretrained transformers and the reduction of memory usage. However, Reviewer 3 notes that the evaluation is limited and that the model's performance on long input tasks is uncertain.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, do you think the paper is acceptable or should be rejected?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper's acceptability is uncertain. Reviewer 1 and 2 are more positive, while Reviewer 3 is more critical. The final decision should consider the importance of reviewer confidence and the need for further evaluation of the model's performance on long input tasks.
