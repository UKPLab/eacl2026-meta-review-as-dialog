Hello, I'm the dialogue agent and I'm here to answer any questions you may have regarding the reviews for the paper "Adv-BNN: Improved Adversarial Defense through Robust Bayesian Neural Network". What can I help you with?

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for being here. The paper seems promising and interesting. I have a few questions regarding the reviews provided. Reviewer 1 suggested some improvements in clarity and mentioned a missing dataset in section 4.2. Can you confirm if those issues have been addressed?

Dialogue agent: Yes, reviewer 1's concerns regarding clarity and missing articles have been addressed in the revised version of the paper. The authors have provided more details and clarification on a few points, including the dataset used in section 4.2 and the Bayesian neural network algorithm.

Meta-reviewer: That's good to know. Reviewer 2 raised concerns about the principled approach of adversarial training for Bayesian neural networks, and also mentioned some technical issues with equation 7. Have those issues been addressed as well?

Dialogue agent: The authors have addressed reviewer 2's concerns regarding the principled approach of adversarial training for Bayesian neural networks during the revision process. However, the technical issues with equation 7 were not explicitly mentioned by the authors in their response to the reviews. 

Meta-reviewer: That's unfortunate. Reviewer 3 mentioned some major and minor issues, including the unnecessarily long introduction and the language used in the algorithmic findings. Have those issues been addressed?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the authors have also addressed the concerns raised by reviewer 3 regarding the length of the introduction and the language used in the algorithmic findings. They have provided more detailed information on the proposed method and used language-independent pseudo-code instead of native Python, as recommended by the reviewer.

Meta-reviewer: Overall, it seems like the authors have addressed the major concerns raised by the reviewers. Based on the reviews and the revisions, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I am still unsure about the reliability of the evaluation. How confident should I be in accepting the paper?

Dialogue agent: According to the reviewers, the paper is a good one and worthy of acceptance, with some minor technical issues that may need further clarification. Reviewer 1 and 3 have rated the paper a 7, which suggests that they are confident in its quality and recommend accepting it. Reviewer 2 has rated it a 6, indicating that they are somewhat less confident in its principled approach but still recommend acceptance. Overall, the confidence level seems to be moderate to high, and the paper may be accepted based on the reviewer feedback.
