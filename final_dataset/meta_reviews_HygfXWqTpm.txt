Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Can you summarize the reviews for "SHINRA: Structuring Wikipedia by Collaborative Contribution" for me?
Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Review 1 raises concerns about the lack of comparison with existing approaches, limited motivation for the structured knowledge base, and insufficient evidence for top-down ontology design. The reviewer also questions the reliability of annotation and the selection of sub-categories. Review 2 expresses concern about the lack of methodological contribution and advises more clarification and detail for several sections. Lastly, Review 3 notes that the paper is well-written and provides a good resource for evaluating knowledge graph construction but did not fully address the limited test data concern. The ensemble learning method was the paper's main contribution. 
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, Dialogue Agent. Based on these reviews, I have some questions for you. Can you tell me what is the paper's type and the paper's objective? 
Dialogue Agent: The type of the paper is "long," and the objective is to structure Wikipedia by aggregating the outputs of different systems through ensemble learning. 
Meta-Reviewer: Excellent. One of the reviews expressed doubt about the reliability of the annotation. What can you tell me about this issue? 
Dialogue Agent: Review 1 raised the concern but does not provide any specific evidence of this issue. 
Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the ensemble learning method? 
Dialogue Agent: The ensemble learning method is the paper's main contribution. According to Review 2, though, the finding that ensemble learning gives better results than individual learners is trivial. 
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, Dialogue Agent. One of the reviews raised concerns about the lack of comparison with existing approaches. Can you tell me if the paper addressed this concern at all? 
Dialogue Agent: No, the paper did not address this concern. 
Meta-Reviewer: And finally, were there any suggestions for improving the writing style and presentation of the paper? 
Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 1 advised the authors to send the paper to a native English speaker for correction, and both Review 1 and 2 pointed out some errors and redundancies in the writing. 
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses, Dialogue Agent. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to reject the paper due to the significant concerns about its contributions, insufficient evidence, and lack of comparison with existing approaches. However, I am less certain about the reliability of the evaluation, as Review 1 and 3 express different levels of confidence. So, can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviews? 
Dialogue Agent: Review 1 expressed a confidence level of 3, meaning the reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct. Review 2 expressed a confidence level of 4, meaning the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. Lastly, Review 3 expressed a confidence level of 3 and stated that the paper is well-written in general. 
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you again, Dialogue Agent. The different levels of confidence among the reviews make it harder for me to reach a decision. I will have to consider this carefully before making a final judgment.
