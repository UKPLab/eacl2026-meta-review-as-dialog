Meta-Reviewer: Hello, can you please provide an overview of the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. This paper proposes a framework called DANGER for generating dangerous scenes to test the robustness of autonomous vehicles. The method involves editing existing driving scenarios with predefined primitives to create new and potentially hazardous driving scenarios. The generated scenarios are evaluated using both image synthesis techniques and user studies to demonstrate their realism and dangerousness.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that overview. Can you tell me more about the reviewers' comments and their ratings?

Dialogue Agent: There are three reviews for this paper. Review 1 is generally positive with a rating of 8, indicating that the paper is in the top 50% of accepted papers and should be considered for acceptance. Review 2 has some concerns, particularly surrounding the novelty of the proposed method and the page limit for the submission. The rating for Review 2 is 5, which is marginally below the acceptance threshold. Finally, Review 3 has several criticisms regarding the originality and significance of the paper, and recommends rejection with a rating of 4.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you elaborate on the shortcomings of the paper mentioned in Review 3?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer mentioned a few issues with the paper. First, they pointed out that the proposed method for generating dangerous scenarios is limited in its originality, as it relies heavily on existing tools and manually constructed primitives. Second, the reviewer stated that it is difficult to assess the significance of the results presented in the paper, particularly in regard to the evaluation methodology. Finally, the reviewer found a number of quality and clarity issues, such as difficult-to-read figures and incomplete user study results.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that summary. Can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. According to the reviewers' comments, Review 1 is relatively confident in their evaluation of the paper with a confidence level of 4 out of 5, indicating that they are confident but not absolutely certain in their assessment. Review 2 is also relatively confident, with a confidence level of 4 out of 5, while Review 3 has a lower confidence level of 3 out of 5.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Given the reviewers' comments and ratings, what is your recommendation regarding the acceptance of this paper?
