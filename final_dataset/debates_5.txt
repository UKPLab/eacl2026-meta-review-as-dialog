Decision Maker(DM): Thank you for explaining your stance on the topic. Can you explain how more domestic surveillance can prevent another 9/11?

For: The government has been using traditional surveillance techniques to prevent terrorist attacks since 9/11. These techniques have been effective in thwarting terrorist plots and attacks, as we have seen in various cases. The dwindling levels of sophistication in terrorist attacks show that surveillance is working. More surveillance can further aid in preventing such disasters from happening again.

Against: I disagree with the notion that more surveillance will prevent another 9/11. The government has already been collecting vast amounts of data on its citizens, and this has not prevented any major terrorist attacks since 9/11. The FBI's failure to interview the right person for a federal job, as mentioned earlier, is evidence of the government's ability to misuse surveillance powers. More surveillance will only lead to even more abuses of power.

DM: How do we balance the need for security and the right to privacy?

For: We need to use surveillance techniques that are minimally invasive and do not interfere with anyone's personal space. We are not advocating for a police state or an overbearing state that invades every aspect of citizens' lives. We want to maintain an equilibrium between security and privacy that serves everyone's interests.

Against: The government already has access to vast amounts of data about its citizens, and has shown a tendency to misuse this data. To protect privacy, we need to limit surveillance powers and hold the government accountable for its actions. Privacy is a fundamental right, and we cannot sacrifice it for the sake of security.

DM: What about the argument that a lack of surveillance can lead to catastrophic events?

For: The threat of terrorism is real, and we need to take all precautions to protect our citizens. We have successfully prevented major terrorist attacks in the past, and this is evidence that surveillance is working. The use of traditional surveillance techniques is not intrusive and does not interfere with anyone's privacy. We need to trust our law enforcement agencies to use these techniques responsibly.

Against: The government's track record of misusing surveillance powers is well documented. More surveillance will only lead to more abuses of power, and could put innocent citizens at risk. We need to limit surveillance powers and ensure that the government is held accountable for its actions. We cannot sacrifice our privacy for the illusion of security.
