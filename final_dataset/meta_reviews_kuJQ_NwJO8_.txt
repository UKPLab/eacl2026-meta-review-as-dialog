Meta-reviewer: Thank you for providing the reviews for the paper "Knowledge-Consistent Dialogue Generation with Knowledge Graphs". Based on the reviews, it seems that the proposed approach is technically solid, and the contributions are significant. However, there are some concerns regarding the lack of empirical comparisons with SOTA methods and other triplets ranking methods. Additionally, the lack of verification of different graph-based neural networks for encoding is a weakness. Reviewer 1 suggests that some classic and recent methods are not compared or discussed, and there is a missing ablation study. Reviewer 2 points out that while the three proposed main models all outperform baselines, it is not clear which aspect of the model truly shines as the best contribution. Reviewer 3 highlights the lack of comparisons with SOTA methods and the grammatical errors in the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for the summary of the reviews. I can provide more information about the paper and the experiments. While we agree that the comparison with SOTA methods could have been included, we chose to compare against existing methods on the OpenDialKG dataset, and we achieved significant improvements in the results. We also conducted extensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of each component of our approach. Regarding the grammatical errors, we will ensure to proofread the paper before submission.

Meta-reviewer: Could you tell me more about the limitations of the proposed approach, and how generalizable it is?

Dialogue Agent: Our approach aims to tackle the problem of generating factually consistent responses in a dialogue context using knowledge graphs. While this is a significant contribution, it does have limitations. For example, the approach relies on the availability and accuracy of the knowledge graph, and the method may not work well in situations where the graph is not comprehensive or up-to-date. Additionally, the method's performance may be affected by the quality of the knowledge retriever and the relevance of the retrieved subgraph to the dialogue context. We argue that the proposed approach can be generalized to other types of knowledge graphs, but this needs to be explored in future work.

Meta-reviewer: Finally, I am concerned about the borderline reject rating from Reviewer 1. Could you comment on that, and how it affects the accept/reject decision?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1's main concern appears to be the lack of comparisons with some classic and recent methods and the missing ablation study. However, our approach still achieves technically sound results, providing a significant contribution to the field of dialogue generation with knowledge graphs. We believe that the strengths of the paper outweigh the weaknesses, and thus, we recommend accepting the paper.
