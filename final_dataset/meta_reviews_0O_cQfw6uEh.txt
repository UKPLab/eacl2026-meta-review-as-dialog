Meta-reviewer: Thank you for being here with me, dialogue agent. I would like to discuss the reviews for the paper titled "Gradient Origin Networks." Can you summarize the key contributions of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Sure. The paper proposes a new type of generative models called Gradient Origin Networks (GONs), which utilize a new inference method for latent variables. Specifically, the authors use the gradient of the latent variables with respect to zero vector as the inferred latent variables. The authors show that this method can be extended to implicit and variational versions and demonstrate the models on image datasets.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. The first reviewer is hesitant to recommend acceptance and suggests a rejection for the paper. Can you elaborate on the reviewer's concerns?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the first reviewer has a few concerns. Firstly, they feel that the model's expressiveness is quite limited, and a justification for the assumption that one step gradient from zero vector equals the latent vector is needed. Secondly, there are issues with the formulation, and they recommend that more quantitative analysis and experiments on more challenging datasets are necessary. Finally, they feel that the claim that GONs save parameters compared to VAEs is confusing and requires clarification.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the second review, it appears that the paper's contributions are interesting but incomplete and require further exploration and evaluation. Can you elaborate on the reviewer's concerns?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the second reviewer feels that the paper is very dense in terms of ideas and falls short in thoroughly evaluating them. For example, the paper contributes several ideas like GONs, implicit GONs, and variational GONs, but each one of those pieces needs to be studied in more detail to be compared and contextualized better with existing approaches. Additionally, the reviewer has several questions regarding the method's stability, the importance of certain choices, and the need for more experiments on larger datasets to determine its usefulness.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summaries. Based on these reviews, it seems that the paper has potential but requires further exploration and evaluation. Can you provide any additional information to help me make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: The paper is of the long type, and the third reviewer recommends acceptance with some reservations. They feel that the method is getting very good results, but the paper is rushed and limited in its evaluation. The reviewer suggests several baselines and missing links to existing literature that the paper should include. However, the reviewer also notes that the paper is well-written and interesting, and they recommend further exploration of the method in larger-scale experiments.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the additional information. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to reject the paper for now. However, I think the paper has potential and could be reconsidered once the authors address the reviewers' concerns and provide more thorough evaluations. Thank you for your help, dialogue agent.

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. Feel free to contact me if you have any further questions or require any assistance.
