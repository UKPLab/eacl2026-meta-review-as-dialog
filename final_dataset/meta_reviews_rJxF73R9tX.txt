 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Knows When it Doesn't Know: Deep Abstaining Classifiers":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Knows When it Doesn't Know: Deep Abstaining Classifiers". Can you provide a summary of the paper and its contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper introduces a new loss function for training deep neural networks that can abstain from making predictions when it is uncertain. The authors claim that their approach can improve the performance of deep learning models on noisy labels. The main contributions of the paper are the introduction of a new modified loss function and an auto-tuning algorithm for the hyperparameter.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. I see that the reviewers have raised some concerns about the clarity of the paper and the lack of comparison with other approaches. Can you address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, I can address those concerns. The paper could be better organized with additional signposting to guide the reader. The authors could also provide more detail on the perturbations they use in their experiments. Additionally, the paper does not provide a direct comparison with other abstainers and the perturbations are somewhat artificial.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the originality and significance of the paper? Do the authors provide enough evidence to support their claims?

Dialogue Agent: The material in the paper is original to my knowledge. The authors provide detail in several use cases and their experimental results support their previous claims. However, the paper does not provide a thorough comparison with other abstainers and the perturbations are somewhat artificial.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your summary. Based on the reviews and the paper's type, I will consider the paper's acceptance. The reviewer confidence is 5, meaning the reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your time. The output of the dialogue should feature only the dialogue, without duplicated sentences, and the dialogue agent should present answers in a summarized form without bullet points.
