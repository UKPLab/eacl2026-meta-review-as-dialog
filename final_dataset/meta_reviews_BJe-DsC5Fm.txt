 Sure, here is a simulated dialogue between a dialogue agent and a meta-reviewer assessing a paper for acceptance or rejection:

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I am assessing a paper for acceptance or rejection. The paper's title is "SignSGD via Zeroth-Order Oracle". Can you tell me about the paper's type and reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper is classified as long, and the reviews are [Review 1 and Review 2].

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Review 1 states that the paper provides a guaranteed algorithm for zero-order sign-gradient descent, but the ideas and estimators are not novel. Review 2 notes that the authors proposed a zero-order version of the recent signSGD algorithm, but the obtained results are relatively straightforward combinations of signSGD with existing zero-order techniques.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: What is the author's main contribution in this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors' main contribution is the development of a zero-order version of signSGD, which does not require the knowledge of the magnitude of the gradient and is suitable for optimizing black-box systems.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: How does the paper address the limitations of signSGD?

Dialogue Agent: The paper addresses the limitations of signSGD by providing a zero-order version of the algorithm, which does not require an unrealistically large mini-batch size and can achieve a slower convergence rate than signSGD by a factor of sqrt(d).

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the paper's strengths include the authors' effort in trying to make their contributions precise and appropriate, and the connection between ZO-signSGD and adversarial examples is further elaborated. However, the reviews also note that the original motivation for signSGD is not clearly explained and the proposed zero-order version of signSGD may not be significantly different from existing zero-order techniques. Additionally, the reviews suggest that the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with signSGD and a discussion of the limitations of the proposed algorithm.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews, how would you rate the paper and what is your confidence in the evaluation?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as marginal above the acceptance threshold (rating: 6) and my confidence in the evaluation is moderate (confidence: 2). The paper's main contribution is the development of a zero-order version of signSGD, but the reviews suggest that the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison with signSGD and a discussion of the limitations of the proposed algorithm.
