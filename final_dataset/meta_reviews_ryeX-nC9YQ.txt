Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you briefly summarize the paper's main contribution?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper provides dimension-free bounds for low-precision training, specifically for the LP-SGD algorithm for convex problems under various generic quantization schemes. The paper also presents extensions to non-linear quantization and discusses conditions under which the convergence of training models with low-precision weights do not rely on model dimension.

Meta-reviewer: Alright. I noticed that Review 1 raised a concern about the paper's significance. What is your take on that?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that the authors do acknowledge the concern and discuss it in the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Fair enough. Review 2 mentions some assumptions made in the analysis, particularly in regards to ell_1 and ell_2 norms. Do these assumptions hold for training neural networks?

Dialogue agent: The reviewer raises a valid question, but I cannot answer it with certainty. The authors do not discuss neural network training specifically, but they do mention that the assumptions are somewhat limiting in terms of explaining why quantization works well for neural network training.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Review 3 also raises some concerns about the paper's title and some assumptions made. Can you comment on those?

Dialogue agent: The reviewer notes that the "dimension-free" bound for linear quantization may still be dependent on dimension. The authors do discuss this in the paper, acknowledging that the bound replaces the use of L2 norms with L1 norms in order to achieve dimension-free bounds. As for the assumptions made, the authors do acknowledge that some of them are stronger than previous works and may limit the universality of the theory.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on these reviews and your input, I'm leaning towards accepting the paper with some minor revisions. What is your confidence level in the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 has a confidence rating of 3, while Reviews 2 and 3 have a confidence rating of 3 and 4, respectively. All three reviews express marginally above acceptance threshold ratings.
