Meta-reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, I am the meta-reviewer assigned to review the paper titled "Stability analysis of SGD through the normalized loss function". Can you give me an overview of the reviews that the paper received and your assessment of them?

Dialogue agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. The paper received three reviews, with ratings of 6, 6, and 4, respectively. Review 1 appreciated the paper's theoretical analysis and experimental results, but raised some concerns about the presentation and technical innovations. Review 2 raised several questions about the writing and definitions which, if addressed, could raise their rating to a 6. Review 3 also appreciated the theoretical analysis but raised concerns regarding the assumptions and dependencies in some of the theorems. This review suggested that the paper may not be good enough for acceptance.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that overview. Can you tell me if there were any major issues that all three reviewers agree on?

Dialogue agent: The three reviews all express some doubts about the novelty and technical contributions of the paper, particularly in comparison to some existing literature. The reviews also raise various issues regarding the assumptions and dependencies in the theorems presented in the paper.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you give me more details about the concerns raised in Review 1?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 appreciates the paper's use of the normalized loss function for analyzing the stability of the SGD algorithm. However, the review suggests that the authors should provide more details on this concept and explain its motivation better. Additionally, they suggest that the authors compare their analysis with the one in Kuzborskij & Lampert (2018) rather than the comparison made in the paper. Finally, the review suggests that the proof presented in the paper is trivial and the authors should explain their technical innovations better.

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. Can you tell me more about the concerns raised in Review 2?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 raises several questions and suggestions mainly about the writing and definitions in the paper. The review suggests giving more discussion about the bound for non-convex theorem and more comparison with related literature, specifically comparing the paper with Hardt et al's work and seeing how they relate to Rademacher complexity. The review also suggests giving end-to-end results in the appendix. Additionally, there are several issues with the definitions in the paper, such as clarifying the role of data vs. parameters, and the meaning of the superscript $\alpha$.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that. And what about the concerns raised in Review 3?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 appreciates the paper's theoretical analysis and experimental results, but raises concerns about the assumptions made in some of the theorems. For instance, the review believes that the strong assumption in Theorem 1 is a bit unrealistic, and the analysis uses existing stability bounds too much. The review also raises concerns about the assumptions made in Theorem 4, particularly on the growing norm assumption of layer-wise weights. The review also points out that the stability bound in Theorem 4 depends on $1 / \| w \|$, which can become large if the weight norms are small. Overall, they suggest that the paper may not be good enough for acceptance.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Thank you for summarizing the reviews for me. Based on what you've told me, it seems that there are some concerns about the novelty and technical contributions of the paper and some fundamental issues with the assumptions made in the theorems. However, there are also some positive feedback about the theoretical analysis and experimental results. Given these issues, what is your recommendation, assuming the paper is long?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews and the concerns raised, it seems that the paper is borderline, and it could go either way depending on the author's response to the reviews. However, based on the major issues raised in the reviews and the fact that the paper is long, I would recommend rejecting the paper.
