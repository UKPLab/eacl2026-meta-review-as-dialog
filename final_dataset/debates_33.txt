Decision Maker: Hi, I'm here to learn more about the debate topic "Don't Give Us Your Tired, Your Poor, Your Huddled Masses". Can you tell me about the arguments for and against it?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. Let's start with the arguments for the motion. One argument is that accepting immigrants who are struggling will put a burden on the economy and social services. 

Decision Maker: That's a fair point. What are some arguments against the motion?

Dialogue Agent: One argument is that America has always been a country for people who are willing to work hard, no matter their starting point. Another argument is that America's diversity is a strength, and accepting immigrants is important for maintaining that diversity.

Decision Maker: I see. What about the argument that immigrants who come to the US will take jobs away from Americans?

Dialogue Agent: There is evidence to suggest that immigrants actually create jobs, rather than taking them away. Many immigrants are entrepreneurs who start their own businesses. Additionally, immigrants can fill gaps in the labor market that might otherwise go unfilled.

Decision Maker: Interesting. What about the argument that accepting too many immigrants will lead to overcrowding and strain public infrastructure?

Dialogue Agent: That's a possibility, but there are also many examples of cities that have successfully integrated large numbers of immigrants without negative consequences. Additionally, welcoming immigrants is the right thing to do, even if it requires some adjustments and investments in infrastructure.

Decision Maker: I see. Based on what you've told me, it seems like the arguments against the motion are stronger. What do you think?

Dialogue Agent: I'm a neutral party in this debate, so I don't have an opinion on the matter. It's up to you to weigh the arguments and make your own decision.
