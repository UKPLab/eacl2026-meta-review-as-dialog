Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for submitting your paper on "Combining policy gradient and Q-learning." I've gone through the reviews provided by the reviewers, and I have a few questions before deciding on whether to accept or reject the paper. 

Dialogue Agent: Thank you, Meta-Reviewer. I'll do my best to answer your questions without providing any opinions or recommendations.

Meta-Reviewer: The first reviewer mentions that the paper could have been presented as an extension or generalization of the dueling Q-network, which would have been more intuitive. How do you respond to this concern? 

Dialogue Agent: While it's true that the proposed algorithm has some similarities with the dueling Q-network, our paper focuses on the connections between value-based methods and policy gradients that have not been established before. We believe that our approach has significant theoretical value and can be useful for a wide range of RL applications beyond the Atari environment, as the third reviewer notes.

Meta-Reviewer: Reviewer 2 expresses concern about the clarity and readability of the paper, especially in section 3.3. How do you plan to address this concern?

Dialogue Agent: We appreciate the reviewer's feedback on improving the readability of our paper. We will revise section 3.3 to provide more explanations and make the links between the methods more explicit. We'll also clarify some minor points and address the typos pointed out by the reviewer.

Meta-Reviewer: Reviewer 2 also suggests that a comparison with the dueling architecture could be added to see if there's an improvement over that method. Do you agree with this suggestion?

Dialogue Agent: While we appreciate the suggestion, we don't believe that a comparison with the dueling architecture is necessary, as our focus is on the connections between value-based methods and policy gradients. However, we will make some additional clarifications on the links to the dueling network in sections 3.3 and 4.1 to address the reviewer's concerns.

Meta-Reviewer: Reviewer 3 seems to be very positive about the paper and gives it a top rating. However, they do raise a minor concern about the non-discounted distribution used for a policy. Can you address this concern?

Dialogue Agent: We appreciate the positive feedback from the reviewer and will address their concern about the stationary distribution used for the policy. While the current version of the paper has no major problems, we'll consider addressing the subtleties between using a discounted and non-discounted distribution in the function approximation case in future work.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews and your answers, I have decided to accept the paper with minor revisions. Please address the concerns raised by the reviewers and make the necessary revisions to the paper. 

Dialogue Agent: Thank you, Meta-Reviewer. We'll revise the paper as suggested by the reviewers and resubmit it for your review.
