Meta-reviewer: Thank you for providing your reviews, they are very informative. From what I gather, the main contributions of the paper are the theoretical analysis on loss-aware weight quantization with full-precision gradients, quantized gradient and clipped quantized gradient, and the experimental results on the performance of quantized networks for deep learning tasks. Reviewer 1 raises some concerns on the clarity of the authors' problem statement, especially in the practical context. Reviewer 2 appreciates the paper's thoroughness but suggests a comparison with existing analyses and further experiments. Reviewer 3 comments on the novelty of the paper's contributions, but raises a caveat on the authors' parallel learning algorithm. 

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your summary of the reviews. Yes, the paper mainly provides theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of quantized networks for distributed deep learning, with a focus on loss-aware weight quantization and the impact of quantization and gradient clipping on convergence properties. We understand Reviewer 1's concern, and we will add more clarity to the introduction and problem statement to address them. As for Reviewer 2, we will include further comparisons with existing analyses, and perform more experiments to address their suggestions. Regarding Reviewer 3's caveat, we acknowledge that all the experiments were done with data-parallelism. We will add more discussion on the benefits and limitations of our algorithm and its generalization to other parallelization methods. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the response. Could you elaborate more on the clarity of the problem statement to address Reviewer 1's concerns? 

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. We will include a clear and concise description of the problem we are trying to solve in the introduction and highlight the importance of gradient compression in the distributed training of deep networks. We will also provide more detailed explanations on how the theoretical results can guide practical algorithm design and how they compare to related works. 

Meta-reviewer: That sounds good. What about Reviewer 2's suggestion on further experiments and comparisons? 

Dialogue Agent: We appreciate Reviewer 2's suggestions on further experiments and comparisons. We will perform more experiments on the impact of weight/gradient quantization with different quantization bit-widths and network architectures, with a focus on comparing our results to existing analyses. We will also include more comprehensive comparisons with related works, including Li et al., 2017 and Wen et al., 2017, in our paper. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Overall, I believe this is a good paper with valuable contributions, and I would recommend it for acceptance. How confident are you in the reviews and their ratings? 

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and their ratings, Reviewer 2 is more positive about the paper and its contributions than Reviewer 1 and 3. While all reviewers have raised important concerns and suggestions, Reviewer 2 thinks that the paper is thorough and interesting despite some minor limitations. Reviewer 1 and 3 are relatively positive but have raised some concerns that need to be addressed. Therefore, I am confident that the overall rating is marginally above acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 4.
