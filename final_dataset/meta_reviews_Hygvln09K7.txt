 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Meta Learning with Fast/Slow Learners":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Meta Learning with Fast/Slow Learners". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a meta-learning architecture that splits the neural network into fast and slow learners, where the slow learner is trained by SGD and the fast learner is trained according to what the meta-learner guides.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has a clear motivation and is easy to read. The idea of training slow and fast learners using different strategies is an interesting approach.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The technique used in this work is a mix of SGD and [Andrychowicz et al., 2016]. The analysis is limited to a simple two-layer linear network, and it is not clear whether this analysis is carried over to the proposed deep nets. Additionally, the paper does not compare to recent results such as Reptile [1] or MT-Nets [2].

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you summarize the reviewer comments for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The reviewers have mixed opinions about the paper. One reviewer finds the paper to be marginally above acceptance threshold, while another reviewer finds it to be marginally below acceptance threshold. Both reviewers mention that the paper has a clear motivation and is easy to read, but they also raise concerns about the limited analysis and the lack of comparison to recent results.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviewer comments. Based on the reviews, what is your recommendation for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would recommend that the paper be accepted with minor revisions. The paper has a clear motivation and an interesting approach, but it could benefit from a more comprehensive analysis and comparison to recent results.
