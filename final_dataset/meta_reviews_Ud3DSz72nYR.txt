Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. From what I understand, one reviewer is confident about the evaluation, and the other two have some concerns about the choice of features and the paper's presentation. Is that a fair summary?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, that's correct.

Meta-Reviewer: Let me start with Review 1. What do you think about their suggestion to explain GVFs more extensively and discuss the effect of the number of features on learning QFs?

Dialogue Agent: I think those are reasonable suggestions, but as a dialogue agent, I can't provide subjective opinions or recommendations. I can only tell you what the reviewers have noted.

Meta-Reviewer: Of course, I understand. Let's move on to Review 2. From what I gather, the reviewer finds the paper well-written and introduces a novel concept, but questions the general applicability of the method due to the reliance on specific GVF feature choices. What's your take on this?

Dialogue Agent: That's correct. The reviewer notes that each environment appears to use carefully engineered features, and the paper does not clearly indicate the process used for selecting them and how these features should be chosen for other environments. Additionally, the paper lacks a quantitative evaluation of the explanations.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. And finally, Review 3 raises concerns about the choice of GVF features and suggests reorganizing the paper. What's your response to this?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer's concerns about the GVF feature choice are noted, and we can address them in our rebuttal by providing more details on our selection process. As for the paper's organization, we can also take their feedback into consideration for future revisions.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your answers. Based on what you've told me, I think we should accept this paper. While there are some concerns raised by the reviewers, it seems that the overall evaluation is positive, and the paper proposes a novel concept that could advance the field of RL interpretability.
