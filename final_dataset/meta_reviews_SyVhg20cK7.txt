 Sure! Here is a simulation of a dialogue between a dialogue agent and a meta-reviewer assessing a paper for acceptance or rejection:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I am reviewing your paper on "Inducing Cooperation via Learning to Reshape Rewards in Semi-Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning". I have some questions about the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Hello! I'd be happy to help answer your questions. Please go ahead and ask away!

Meta-Reviewer: Great, let's start. In section 3.2, you discuss the scalability of your approach. However, I noticed that the number of parameters in your DQN network increases with the number of agents. Can you explain why this is the case, and how your approach can be considered scalable?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! In our approach, we use a DQN network for each agent to learn the local Q-values. The number of parameters in the DQN network increases with the number of agents, but we argue that this is not a limitation. Our approach is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different environments, and the increase in parameters can be justified by the need for more accurate Q-value estimates as the number of agents increases.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. But isn't the increase in parameters a potential source of overfitting, especially in a multi-agent setting where the state and action spaces are larger?

Dialogue Agent: That's a valid concern, but we address this issue by using a regularization term in our reward shaping algorithm. This term helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the learned Q-values are smooth and stable. Additionally, we perform experiments with different numbers of agents and observe that our approach is robust to changes in the number of agents.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the choice of reward shaping formula in (2) and (3)? Can you motivate the form of the shaping term and compare it to other formulations?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The choice of reward shaping formula in (2) and (3) is based on our desire to encourage cooperative behavior in the multi-agent setting. The shaping term is designed to capture the TD-error of other agents, which helps to align the learning process with the desired cooperative outcome. We compare our approach to other formulations, such as Value Decomposition Networks (Sunehag 2017), and show that our approach outperforms these formulations in terms of cooperative behavior.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Moving on to section 4.2, I noticed that the tables in this section are not for the case of using independent Q-learning. Can you explain why this is the case, and whether the results in this section are still relevant for your approach?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, you are correct that the tables in section 4.2 are not for the case of using independent Q-learning. However, we argue that the results in this section are still relevant for our approach, as they demonstrate the effectiveness of our reward shaping algorithm in promoting cooperative behavior. Additionally, we note that our approach can be easily extended to independent Q-learning by using the same reward shaping formula.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Finally, I would like to ask about the choice of using a feed-forward policy in a partially observable multi-agent setting. Can you justify this choice, and compare it to other policy choices such as recurrent policies?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! We choose to use a feed-forward policy in our approach because it is simpler and more computationally efficient than recurrent policies. Additionally, we note that feed-forward policies are more common in multi-agent settings, as they are easier to implement and more scalable. While recurrent policies may be more suitable for certain tasks, we argue that our approach is more practical and effective for multi-agent settings.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on our conversation, I would rate this paper as marginally below acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 4. The concerns I have outweigh the contributions of the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback! We will take your comments into consideration and work to address the concerns you have raised.
