Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "Active Learning with Safety Constraints". It seems to be a technically solid paper, but there are some concerns. Can you tell me more about the paper's contribution and the type of paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, certainly. The paper proposes an algorithm for the best arm identification problem from the perspective of a linear bandits setup with safety constraints. The paper is of long type.

Meta-Reviewer: The paper discusses some weaknesses, such as limited evaluation, and there are concerns about the accessibility of the paper. Can you comment on these concerns?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Review 1 notes that the paper is not easily accessible, but they also acknowledge that it might be due to their lack of familiarity with active learning from a linear bandits perspective. As for the limited evaluation, Review 2 notes that there could be more meaningful baselines to justify the methodology, but they acknowledge the importance of the problem and the soundness of the theoretical results. Review 3, on the other hand, mentions that the paper is technically sound and the writing quality is above average.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. One review mentions potential applications. Can you give me more information about the societal impact of this work?

Dialogue agent: The paper discusses the societal impact and potential limitations of their framework. They argue that their framework can be used to optimize various societal needs with safety constraints, such as personalized medicine, online advertising, and power systems control.

Meta-Reviewer: I'm interested in the confidence ratings of the reviews. Review 1 has a low confidence rating, while Review 2 and Review 3 have medium confidence ratings. Can you explain what this means?

Dialogue agent: A low confidence rating means that the reviewer's assessment is an educated guess, and the submission is not in their area, or the submission was difficult to understand. While medium confidence ratings mean that reviewers are willing to defend their assessment, but it is quite likely that they did not understand the central parts of the submission, or they are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on these reviews, I am leaning towards a borderline accept. However, I am still concerned about the limited evaluation. Can you comment on this further?

Dialogue agent: While there is limited evaluation in the paper, the algorithm is theoretically sound and is proved to be $(\delta, \epsilon)$-PAC. Additionally, the paper has experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Nevertheless, it is understandable to be cautious about the findings.

Meta-Reviewer: I appreciate your input. Given the overall strengths and weaknesses, I have decided to accept the paper. Thank you for your assistance.
