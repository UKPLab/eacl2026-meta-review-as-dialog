Meta-reviewer: Thank you for joining me. I have gone through the reviews and now I have some questions for you. Can you explain to me the contribution of this paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, certainly. This paper proposes a method for generating a multi-agent market simulator using GANs to calibrate the parameters of the simulator. The proposed method can be used to tune any time series model. 

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me more about the experiments conducted in this paper?

Dialogue agent: The experiments in this paper evaluate the proposed method on a parametrized limit order book market simulator. The goal of the experiments is to use the simulator to generate synthetic data that closely matches real stock market data. However, Review 1 suggested that the evaluation should have been more fine-grained and should have taken into consideration a richer set of statistics.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Do the experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods?

Dialogue agent: The paper does not make a direct comparison with existing methods. However, the proposed method is evaluated against a baseline that does not use a GAN for calibration, and the results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline. 

Meta-reviewer: As the paper type is long and the experiments have some weaknesses, how confident are you in the results?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 suggests that the paper's rating is marginally below acceptance threshold, rating it as 5. Review 2 gave a rating of 7, which indicates that the paper is good and should be accepted. On the other hand, Review 3 suggests the paper should be rejected, rating it as 3. As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations regarding whether the paper should be accepted or rejected. 

Meta-reviewer: I understand. However, could you tell me how confident the reviewers are in their ratings?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 seems to be very familiar with the relevant literature and is absolutely certain about their evaluation. Review 2, on the other hand, is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. Review 3 also seems confident but not absolutely certain about their evaluation. 

Meta-reviewer: Ok, I get it. My final question is about the presentation of the paper. Review 3 provides some feedback on the layout and clarity, could you tell me if these problems are significant?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 suggests that the paper is not clearly written and not self-contained. They provide feedback on the layout and suggest that some figures should be reformatted and some contents should be shown in tables instead of figures. They also suggest we proofread the entire text for grammar errors. As a dialogue agent, I cannot make judgments on these issues, but I can provide this feedback to the authors. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. You have been very informative.
