Meta-reviewer: Hello, I am the meta-reviewer for the paper "Human-AI Collaborative Bayesian Optimization". Can you provide me with an overview of the paper's contribution and the general feedback received from the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Yes, certainly. The paper proposes a new approach for human-AI collaboration in Bayesian optimization, where human experts can provide feedback to the optimization algorithm to improve its performance. The feedback can come in the form of recommendations for sample points or good and bad regions within the search space. The paper provides a theoretical framework to justify the approach and also validates it empirically against a baseline method without expert feedback. The reviews have generally been positive, but there are some concerns that need to be addressed before final acceptance.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that summary. Could you provide me with some details on the specific concerns raised by each reviewer?

Dialogue agent: Of course. Reviewer 1 raised concerns about the lack of rigor in the characterization of the requirements of human experts and the need for formal verification of human properties in the study. They also suggested that the paper could benefit from handling non-Gaussian Bayesian optimization processes. Reviewer 2 questioned the originality and significance of the paper's contribution in the context of related work and recommended that the authors address the limitations and improvement perspectives in the conclusion section. Reviewer 3 suggested that it was not clear whether the proposed method would achieve the optimal solution faster than the standard Bayesian optimization and recommended adding a figure comparing the number of iterations of the optimal regret for all the different models tested.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the detailed feedback. In your opinion, what is the overall confidence level of the reviewers in their assessment of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 expressed a moderate level of confidence in their assessment, while Reviewer 2 expressed a slightly lower confidence level. Reviewer 3 expressed a higher level of confidence.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the overall feedback, do you have any opinion on whether the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation. However, all reviewers have given a weak accept rating, indicating that the paper is technically solid and has moderate-to-high impact, with no major concerns with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility, or ethical considerations. It is up to you as the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of the concerns raised and decide whether to accept or reject the paper.
