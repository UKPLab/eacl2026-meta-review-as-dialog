Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have reviewed the reviews for the paper titled "Generalization and Regularization in DQN". I am confused about the conflicting ratings from Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2. Reviewer 1 gave a rating of 6, which is marginally above acceptance threshold and found the paper to be valuable in terms of highlighting the importance of more regularization in practice. Reviewer 2, on the other hand, gave a rating of 5 which is marginally below acceptance threshold and raised concerns about the experimental methodology, questioning the chosen games for experimentation and lack of comparison with other approaches. What are your thoughts on these discrepancies?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I understand that Reviewer 1 found the paper to be valuable in highlighting the importance of regularization and the unresolved dispute of what generalization should mean. Reviewer 2, however, raised concerns about the experiments and the choice of games for experimentation. It is important to note that this is a long paper and may have some strengths in one area and weaknesses in another. As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but I can clarify any doubts that you may have regarding the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your response. Given the conflicting ratings, how confident are the reviewers in their evaluations?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 had a confidence level of 3, which means that they were fairly confident that the evaluation was correct. Reviewer 2 had a confidence level of 5, which means that they were absolutely certain that the evaluation was correct and were very familiar with the relevant literature. Reviewer 3 also had a confidence level of 5 and found the paper to be well-written with clear and sound experimental methodology.

Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper discusses the ability of DQNs to perform well on variants of the same environment through regularization and warm-starting. However, Reviewer 1 raises doubts about what generalization should mean and if it is an unrealistic expectation. Can you clarify any points regarding this?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can say that Reviewer 1 raises an interesting point about what generalization should mean and if it is an unrealistic expectation. The paper does highlight the importance of regularization and warm-starting for improved sample efficiency and performance. The significance of the paper lies in the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of regularization, particularly in DQNs, and the implications for future research in deep RL.

Meta-Reviewer: I understand that you cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but can you provide any further clarifications regarding the experimental methodology or the chosen games for experimentation?

Dialogue Agent: The experimental methodology in the paper is clear and sound, with well-defined experiments and evaluation metrics. However, Reviewer 2 raises concerns about the choice of games for experimentation and the lack of comparison with other approaches. The paper uses four games with 13 different flavors for experimentation and evaluates the performance of regularized fine-tuning and fine-tuning compared to models trained from scratch. The significance of the paper lies in the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of regularization in DQNs for improved sample efficiency and performance.
