 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper about neural network gradient-based learning of black-box function interfaces. What are your thoughts on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper presents an approach called EstiNet, which trains a hybrid model using both neural networks and black-box functions. The key idea is to approximate the black-box functions using a neural network during training, and use the true black-box functions at test time. The reviews mention that the approach outperforms baselines and shows promise in synthetic tasks.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main concerns raised by the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: One concern is the general applicability of the proposed approach, as some functions may be hard to approximate using neural networks. Another concern is the need for more experimental details and a discussion of potential real-world applications.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Okay, I see. What about the training procedure used in the experiments?

Dialogue Agent: The authors propose three different training procedures: offline training, online training, and hybrid training. The hybrid training procedure is the best, as it combines the advantages of both online and offline training. However, the reviewers suggest that a bandit-inspired approach may be a better solution.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews and your summary, what is your recommendation for acceptance or rejection?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the paper's contributions, I would recommend accepting the paper with a confidence level of 3. The reviewers have provided valuable feedback and the paper shows promise in the field of neural network gradient-based learning of black-box function interfaces.
