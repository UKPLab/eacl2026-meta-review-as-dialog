 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Sustainable Online Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding":

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Sustainable Online Reinforcement Learning for Auto-bidding". Can you help me understand the key contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors of this paper propose a sustainable online reinforcement learning paradigm for auto-bidding, which addresses the problem of inconsistency between the online and offline settings in the outbidding problem with safeguards. The proposed method uses a safe policy to explore the real environment and improve the auto-bidding policies through direct interactions with the environment.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has several strengths. Firstly, it addresses an important problem in practice, as auto-bidding is becoming more popular in real-world applications. Secondly, the authors provide a technically solid paper with high impact on at least one sub-area, and the proposed method achieves good performance empirically. Finally, the paper is well-written and clearly states the contribution.

Meta-reviewer: What about the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has a few weaknesses. Firstly, there is no theoretical guarantee for the proposed bidding algorithm, which could be a concern for some readers. Secondly, the presentation could be improved, as some figures are not detailedly explained in the main text. Finally, the authors fail to compare the proposed method to state-of-the-art works in the auto-bidding field.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on your assessment, what would be your recommendation for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would recommend accepting the paper with a rating of 7: Accept. The paper is technically solid, with high impact on at least one sub-area, and the proposed method achieves good performance empirically. However, the presentation could be improved, and the authors fail to compare the proposed method to state-of-the-art works in the auto-bidding field.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help. I will consider your recommendation when making my final decision.
