Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for all the reviews. Review 1 raises some concerns regarding the methodology in the paper, while Review 2 seems to appreciate the novelty of the proposed approach. Review 3 brings up an issue of how the proposed method deals with factors such as age, gender, and race. Can you provide more insights regarding these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Regarding Review 1, the paper addresses some concerns raised by the reviewer in the text. The authors acknowledge that the proposed method may not work effectively when the expressions of individuals with different IDs differ greatly in a batch. They also mention that the variations among references are not considered. However, the experiments conducted by the authors show that the proposed method exceeds most existing works.

Regarding Review 2, the reviewer appreciates the novelty of the proposed approach and the competitive results. The reviewer suggests comparing the proposed method with a small transformer encoder to compute the mean features, and including the performance of the proposed approach on AffectNet and SEWA. The authors will consider these suggestions while improving the manuscript’s presentation and writing substantially for better clarity. The authors will also provide further clarification on the behavior of the curves in Figure 5 and the corresponding training loss.

Regarding Review 3, the reviewer raises a valid point regarding the impact of factors such as age, gender, and race on the proposed approach. The authors acknowledge that this is an important consideration for generalized facial expression recognition. However, they indicate that the proposed method focuses on removing identity-based similarities encountered in the batch. One way to address this limitation is to augment the training data with diverse demographic groups.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the answers. Review 1 has raised some valid concerns, but I see that the proposed approach has achieved good results in experiments, and the authors have acknowledged the limitations. Therefore, I think we can consider this paper for acceptance. However, Review 2 has some suggestions that the authors may consider for improving the manuscript's clarity and providing more comparisons. I am satisfied with the response to Review 3.

Regarding the rating, Reviewers 2 and 3 seem to recommend accepting the paper, and Reviewer 1 is borderline. Therefore, the confidence levels are not high enough for a strong accept. I would rate this paper a weak accept with a confidence level of 4.
