 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "AutoMS: Automatic Model Selection for Novelty Detection with Error Rate Control":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "AutoMS: Automatic Model Selection for Novelty Detection with Error Rate Control". Can you provide a summary of the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper "AutoMS: Automatic Model Selection for Novelty Detection with Error Rate Control" proposes a novel approach to novelty detection that automatically selects a best detection model while simultaneously controlling the false discovery rate. The authors propose a general AutoML framework for novelty detection and controlling the error rate of the model. The paper provides a theoretical bound of FDR and experiments are conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the strengths of the paper include the proposal of a unified framework that can be combined with different base detectors, the provision of a theoretical bound of FDR, and the conduct of extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of AutoMS on both synthetic and real-world data. However, one of the weaknesses noted is that only several real-world datasets are selected in the experiments, and the authors are encouraged to conduct a more thorough comparison with MetaOD, another related work.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What is the confidence level of the reviewers in their assessment?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the reviewers have a moderate to high level of confidence in their assessment, but one reviewer notes that they are willing to defend their assessment but it is quite likely that they did not understand the central parts of the submission or that they are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and your summaries, I will make my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any further information or clarification.
