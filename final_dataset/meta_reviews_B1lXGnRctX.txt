Meta-reviewer: Hello, I would like to discuss the reviews for the paper titled "Classification in the dark using tactile exploration." 

Dialogue agent: Sure, I'm here to help. What would you like to know? 

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me the type of paper and the main problem the authors aim to solve? 

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper is a long type, and the authors propose a task of classifying objects from tactile signals. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 1 mentions some concerns about the use of averaged haptic readings over a series of explorations. Can you elaborate on this issue? 

Dialogue agent: The approach of averaging haptic readings seems certain to blur and confound things unnecessarily, which makes it harder for the system to learn the relationship between pose, object form, and sensation. 

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 suggests that the paper lacks significance and the proposed method is more like a naive baseline. Is there any explanation for this? 

Dialogue agent: The proposed method is simple non-end-to-end predictors trained by supervised learning. Therefore, the proposed model seems more like a naive baseline. Review 2 also suggests that the performance is not impressive. 

Meta-reviewer: Review 3 criticizes the writing quality and presentation of the problem. Can you give me some examples of the issues raised in this review? 

Dialogue agent: Sure, the reviewer mentions that the paper is poorly written and looks like it was not proof-read. He also points out incomplete and out-of-nowhere sentences, and many references that are not well-introduced and justified. Additionally, domain-specific concepts and procedures of most importance to this work are not explained clearly. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the insights. Based on the reviews, would you recommend accepting or rejecting the paper? 

Dialogue agent: I'm not in a position to make recommendations. However, the reviews suggest significant weaknesses in the paper, and reviewer confidence is relatively high. The final decision is up to you.
