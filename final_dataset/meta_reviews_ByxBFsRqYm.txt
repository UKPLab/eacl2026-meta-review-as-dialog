Meta-Reviewer: Thank you both for your thorough reviews of this paper. I see that Reviewer 1 has given the paper a strong acceptance recommendation, while Reviewer 2 has some reservations but still thinks it marginally meets the acceptance threshold. Reviewer 3 seems to have a more positive overall impression of the paper, but notes that some of the theoretical contributions are not groundbreaking. 

Before I make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper, I would like to ask both of you some follow-up questions. Firstly, Reviewer 1, could you expand on the importance of comparing this work to Deudon et al. (2018)? Would you say that the lack of comparison is significant enough to warrant rejection? Secondly, Reviewer 2, can you provide some insight into the scalability of the approach? Would you say that the results presented in the paper indicate that it has potential for larger-scale problems? 

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your questions, Meta-Reviewer. Regarding the comparison to Deudon et al. (2018), the lack of direct comparison is a concern, as the two papers share a common approach and some similarities in methodology. However, it is up to the discretion of the authors as to whether they consider this omission to be significant enough to warrant rejection. As for scalability, the paper's results suggest that the approach may struggle with larger instances of the TSP problem, and it is still uncertain whether the method can scale to much larger problems or solve them in a reasonable inference running time.

Reviewer 1: Thank you for your response, Dialogue Agent. I believe that the lack of comparison to Deudon et al. (2018) is a significant limitation of the paper and needs to be addressed before a decision can be made. However, I do not believe that it warrants automatic rejection, and think that the authors should be given an opportunity to address this issue in their revisions.

Reviewer 2: I agree with Dialogue Agent's response regarding scalability, and think that the paper's results indicate that there is potential for the approach to be used with larger scale problems with some improvements in methodology. However, I also believe that the lack of comparisons to state-of-the-art TSP-specific algorithms is also a concern, and this should be addressed in the revisions.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you both for your responses. It seems that there are some concerns that need to be addressed in the revisions, particularly regarding the comparison to previous works and the scalability of the approach. However, both of you believe that these issues do not warrant automatic rejection, and that the paper has some strengths that make it worthy of acceptance with revisions. I will take your feedback into account and provide the authors with the necessary revisions.
