Meta-reviewer: Thank you for submitting your paper. I have read the reviews carefully and have a few questions that I would like to ask before making a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.

Dialogue agent: Sure, I will do my best to answer your questions.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 1 mentions some concerns about the experimental evaluation. Can you provide more details on the accuracy/generalizability of $\delta$ in the experiments?

Dialogue agent: I am unable to provide my opinion or recommendations, but I can tell you that the authors did not provide further details on the accuracy/generalizability of $\delta$ in the experiments. However, they did provide the necessary information and results in their paper, which can be seen in Figure 1 and Section 3.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 2 suggests that the explanations offered by the Shapley value framework do not necessarily suggest any particular intervention. Can you comment on this?

Dialogue agent: Again, I cannot provide my opinion or recommendations, but I can tell you that the authors have also discussed the limitations and potential misuse of their method in Section 4. Specifically, they noted that their method does not provide guidance on what specific changes to make in the data to achieve fairness, and that the interpretation of feature attributions should be based on domain knowledge and further analysis.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 3 suggests that there are some areas in the clarity of the paper that could be improved. Can you provide further clarification on some of the equations and terminologies used in the paper?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. I can point you to where the authors have provided some clarifications in their paper. For instance, in Section 2, they explained that "y" refers to the label they are explaining, and in Section 3.2, they discussed the idea that suppressed models should not rely on sex at all. They also explained the notations and terminologies used in Section 2.1 and Section 2.2.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Just one last question, which point of view should I consider more important when making my final decision: the higher quality review with lower confidence or the lower quality review with higher confidence?

Dialogue agent: As an unbiased dialogue agent, I cannot provide you with any advice or recommendations in this regard. It is up to you to weigh the importance of the reviews and assess the quality and validity of the reviewers' evaluations.
