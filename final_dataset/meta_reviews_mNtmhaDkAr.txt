 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a simulation of a dialogue between a dialogue agent and a meta-reviewer assessing a paper for acceptance or rejection, based on the provided reviews:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm the meta-reviewer for this paper, and I have some questions about the reviews. Can you help me understand the paper and the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! The paper is titled "Predicting Inductive Biases of Pre-Trained Models" and it explores the relationship between extractability of features from pre-trained representations and how much a fine-tuned model uses that feature. The reviews are [Review 1:After reading author responses:Thank you to the authors for your detailed responses. With regard to the highlighted implication that "the harder feature can be obscured completely by a spurious one; i.e., there are settings in which the model just won't adopt the harder feature at all" --  to clarify, while my phrasing may not have made this apparent, I was assuming this implication in my interpretation of the results. So my impression of the finding is not changed substantially by the author response. However, I do want to give appropriate acknowledgment of the value of explicitly testing/confirming intuitive explanations of model behaviors, and it is clear that other reviewers find value in the contribution, so I am bumping my score up a bit.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~This paper addresses a seeming contradiction between findings that indicate encoding of linguistic information in models' internal representations, and findings that show models not to use more sophisticated linguistic information during fine-tuning on downstream tasks. The paper hypothesizes that a model's use of a given feature can be explained as a function of extractability of the feature in combinationwith the amount of evidence for that feature's predictive reliability. The authors test on toy, non-language data as well as natural language data, and find support for their hypothesis. All in all I think this is a reasonably clear and well-written paper, with a concrete and intuitivehypothesis. My main concern is that the motivating issue is a bit of a strawman, in that the posited explanationwas fairly obvious as a means of reconciling the "contradiction" raised at the start of the paper. I can't speak for the rest of the community, and it may be that this is something that people have found puzzling -- but speaking for myself I can say that I haven't at any point considered the highlighted "contradiction" to be a contradiction, having simply assumed something like the explanation hypothesized in this paper. Now, there is of course value in providing concrete evidence supporting intuitive assumptions made by the community. However, as the authors point out,  relatedintuitions have already been supported by, e.g., evidence that models will more readily pick up on "easy" examples over "difficult" examples. So it's not clear to me that the paper is making a sufficiently novel, surprising contribution at present.I think one way in which these findings would be more compelling would be if the measure of extractability were defined independently of empirical classifier sensitivity. As it is, the experiments are seemingly demonstratingthat the more readily a classifier is able to pick up on a given feature, the more readily another classifier will use that feature during learning.  I have to assume that this will strike most readers as obvious. However, if extractability/MDL were measured independently of classification performance, then we would presumably learn some interesting and valuable things about what determines extractability for these models.], [Review 2:The paper aims to bridge the gap between model interpretation using probing and model's use of spurious features. They show that the findings of MDL with respect to a feature correlate with the extractability of the feature, given the evidence of representing the feature is available in the training data. The results are presented using both synthetic and natural language data.I really like the premise of the paper, which is connecting the research on the linguistic learning of a model with the presence of important and spurious features in the data. One issue I have with the work is the simplistic assumptions that are likely to be different in the real-world data. Real-world data may have various spurious features and it is possible that not one feature alone is playing a role in pushing the model to rely on spurious features. It can be a combination of spurious features plus the relative presence of important features. It is hard to imagine how this method will scale to real-world datasets. I would like the authors to comment on it.Moreover, the findings are quite expected. In general, the probing methods including MDL were mainly aimed at analyzing the linguistic learning of the representations. Here, the authors are using MDL to look at how input features are represented in the model. Statistically, MDL is likely to look at the same training data as the real-world data.
