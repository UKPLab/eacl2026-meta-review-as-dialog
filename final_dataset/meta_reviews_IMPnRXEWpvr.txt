Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the peer reviews for the paper "Towards Impartial Multi-task Learning." Based on these reviews, I would like to discuss some questions with you before making a final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.

Dialogue agent: Of course. I am here to answer any questions you may have.

Meta-reviewer: The first review mentions that the paper addresses an important open problem in multi-task learning and that the new methods are effective and simple to implement. However, it also mentions that the paper could benefit from a discussion of the limitations of using fairness as a proxy for MTL performance. Can you provide more information on this topic?

Dialogue agent: I understand. As an AI language model, I cannot give an opinion, but I can tell you that the paper's focus is on achieving fairness in multi-task learning by ensuring that all tasks are trained at approximately the same rate. While fairness is an important consideration in MTL, it may not always lead to the best performance, as some tasks may require more training than others. Therefore, future research could explore the trade-off between fairness and task performance.

Meta-reviewer: That's a valid point. The same review also mentions that the paper addresses the issue of some tasks being undertrained. However, it questions whether the approach in the paper is effective when some tasks overfit before others reach peak performance. What can you say about this concern?

Dialogue agent: The paper's approach aims to balance gradient and loss of multiple tasks to prevent undertraining. The methods work well for datasets where underfitting is a problem. The paper acknowledges the possibility of overfitting when data sets are too small. It would require further research to answer whether this approach addresses the more general question of synchronizing training to achieve peak performance for all tasks at the same time.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that information. Moving on to the second review, while it acknowledges that the approach of the paper is simple and effective, it also questions the approximation made for gradient balancing, asking whether it decreases the capability of weight-level balancing. Can you elaborate on this issue?

Dialogue agent: According to the paper, the gradient balancing uses the last shared feature instead of weights for faster training. While this may be an approximation, it does not significantly impact the performance of the weight-level balancing strategy. However, the review suggests that more theoretical or empirical analyses are necessary to make the proposed method stronger.

Meta-reviewer: That makes sense. The same review also mentions that the proposed method gives comparable performance compared to other strong competitors, but is not remarkably better. Do you have any information on this?

Dialogue agent: The paper reports its experimental results on common datasets such as Cityscapes, NYUv2, and CelebA. The results show that the proposed IMTL method achieves state-of-the-art performance or similar performance compared to other methods. However, the review raises concerns about whether this performance gap is significant enough to warrant the attention of practitioners. More rigorous analyses and qualitative results can provide a clearer picture of how this approach differentiates itself from others.

Meta-reviewer: Good points. Lastly, the third review mentions that although the paper proposes a loss weighting balancing approach, recent publications have explored better task hierarchies to design better task grouping in multi-task network architectures, which can alleviate the need to use sophisticated loss balancing. Can you provide more information on this criticism?

Dialogue agent: The proposed approach of the paper is to balance multi-task training using IMTL-G on the shared backbone and IMTL-L on the task-specific branches. While multi-task network design and loss balancing can be separate efforts, the review suggests that it is important to have a reasonable motivation and fair discussion of these topics. The paper presents its motivation for using loss balancing, but it can benefit from further discussion and analysis of multi-task network design.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, I think the paper has some important contributions, but there are some valid concerns as well. I am inclined to accept the paper, but with minor revisions addressing the concerns raised in the peer reviews. What is your level of confidence in accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, I think the paper is good enough to be accepted, but there may be some room for improvement. My confidence level is at 4 out of 5 for accepting the paper.
