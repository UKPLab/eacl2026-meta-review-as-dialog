Buyer: Hi, can you tell me about the Whoowasit? Award-Winning Board Game Electronics?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. It's a game where players work together to find the thief who stole the ring. You use an electronic talking chest to communicate with animals and find keys to open chests.

Buyer: Are there any age limitations on this game?

Dialogue Agent: The manufacturer suggests it for ages 7-99, but some reviewers have said that children as young as 4 have enjoyed playing it.

Buyer: Is it easy to play?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, many reviewers describe it as simple to play. However, some also mention the lengthy instructions.

Buyer: Is it a durable game?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, many reviewers have commented on the sturdy box and contents. It's also been described as a well-made game.

Buyer: Are there any specific things I should know before buying it?

Dialogue Agent: It's good to take notes when playing on higher difficulties and half of the board is blocked by doors you can't enter. The electronic talking box is also considered dated by some reviewers.

Buyer: Thanks for the information. Based on what you've told me, I think I'll take a chance and buy it.
