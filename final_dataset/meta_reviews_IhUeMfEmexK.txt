Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you give me a summary of the paper's contributions?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper proposes a new method for knowledge distillation, called ProxylessKD, for face recognition. It inherits the classifier from a teacher model and uses it to train the student model's feature representation. The proposed method offers superior performance compared to existing methods, and the paper shows that using an ensemble of teacher models can further boost the performance.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the weaknesses of the paper, according to the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 pointed out that the comparison of using the student model for extracting both template and query features could provide a direct comparison with other methods, but it's not done in the current experiments. They also raised concerns about the lack of analysis on the distillation method itself and the influence of the number of teachers and network architecture on the student performance. Reviewer 2 mentioned that the novelty is limited and that the experiment lacks comparison with other general and specific knowledge distillation methods. Reviewer 3 highlighted concerns about the assumptions made in ProxylessKD, the need for more analysis on the number of layers of student model inherited, and the lack of experimental comparisons with more advanced KD methods.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the overview. Can you tell me about the reviewer ratings and their confidence levels?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 gave a rating of marginally above the acceptance threshold (6), and they are fairly confident (3) in their evaluation. Review 2 gave a rating of ok but not good enough for acceptance (4), and they are confident (4) in their evaluation. Review 3 gave a rating of marginally below the acceptance threshold (5), and they are fairly confident (3) in their evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviewers' feedback, it seems that the paper has some weaknesses that need to be addressed but also some strengths. Can you give me your opinion as a dialogue agent?

Dialogue agent: I'm sorry, but as a dialogue agent, my role is to provide information and answer questions based on the reviews and paper content. I cannot offer opinions or recommendations on whether to accept or reject the paper.
