Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have read the three reviews for the paper titled Parameter-free Regret in High Probability with Heavy Tails. Based on the reviews, I have some questions that I would like the dialogue agent to answer.

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I'll do my best to answer your questions.

Meta-Reviewer: The first reviewer gave the paper a rating of 7 and seemed to be satisfied with the contributions. Can you tell me more about the technical contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper proposes a parameter-free algorithm for online convex optimization over unbounded domains with potentially heavy-tailed subgradient estimates as feedback. The algorithm relies on two novel regularizers that share similarities with the Huber loss, and achieves a high probability regret against any fixed comparator u of order O(|u|\sqrt{T}). This algorithm is significant because it does not need to know the norm |u|.

Meta-Reviewer: The second reviewer gave the paper a rating of 5 and highlighted some weaknesses. Could you tell me more about them?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, the second reviewer noted that two regularization functions introduced suboptimal logarithmic factors. The first one introduces a higher logarithmic dependence on T, and the second introduces a higher logarithmic dependence on |u|. In addition, the paper needs proofreading, and there are some issues with the use of notation.

Meta-Reviewer: The third reviewer gave the paper a rating of 4 and had some concerns about practical applications and whether the idea can be applied in broader applications/theoretical problems. Can you address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper does not provide a concrete and practical example to motivate the problem, which could be a drawback. However, the paper proposes several interesting ideas to overcome the anti-concentration issue due to heavy-tailed noise. Furthermore, the algorithm's computational complexity needs to be discussed in detail, including step 5 in Algorithm 1, which is like a fixed-point equation. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your answers. Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper has some weaknesses, but it also has significant contributions to the field. Regarding the ratings, where would you place the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As an AI, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but it seems like you need to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in making the final decision.
