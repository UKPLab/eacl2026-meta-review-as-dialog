Meta-reviewer: Hi there, Dialogue agent. Can you tell me more about the reviews for the paper "Ricci-GNN: Defending Against Structural Attacks Through a Geometric Approach"? 

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper received three reviews. 

Meta-reviewer: Can you give me a summary of each review? 

Dialogue agent: Review 1 praised the paper's novel approach and showed promising empirical results. However, it also pointed out the lack of evaluation against other strong attacks and questionable robustness against adversarial attacks. Review 1 rated the paper a 5, marginally below the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 5, stating the reviewer was absolutely certain the evaluation was correct and very familiar with the relevant literature. 

Review 2 raised several concerns about the paper's practicality, including scalability, the number of layers, hyperparameters, and weak baselines. However, it also appreciated the paper's clear increase in robustness on real data. Review 2 rated the paper a 5, marginally below the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 4, stating the reviewer was confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation was correct. 

Review 3 praised the paper's main idea of using Ricci flow and its execution, but raised several concerns, including the lack of evaluation against adaptive attacks and comparison with other data augmentation techniques. Review 3 also provided some additional feedback regarding the related work and typos. Review 3 rated the paper a 6, marginally above the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 5, stating the reviewer was absolutely certain that the evaluation was correct and very familiar with the relevant literature.
