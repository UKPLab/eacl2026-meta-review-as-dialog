Meta-reviewer: Hello. I have read the reviews for the paper "Embedding game: dimensionality reduction as a two-person zero-sum game" and I am trying to decide whether to accept or reject it. Can you tell me more about the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper received three reviews. Review 1 praises the paper for addressing an important topic and being clearly written, but raises concerns regarding the validity of some proposed formulations and the details of the proposed method. The rating for this review is 3: Reject. Review 2 criticizes the paper for having major technical flaws, poor evaluation, and limited impact, but also acknowledges some strengths, such as the clever formulation of the approximation in section 2. The rating for this review is 2: Strong Reject. Review 3 considers the proposed approach as technically solid but raises concerns about limited quantitative results, comparatively worse performance than sampled-edge algorithms, and insufficient discussion of learning rate selection. The rating for this review is 4: Borderline reject.

Meta-reviewer: Based on these reviews, I am inclined to reject the paper. However, I am not sure how to weigh the different ratings. Review 1 has the highest confidence, but Review 2 has the lowest rating.

Dialogue agent: The confidence levels only reflect the level of certainty of the reviewers in their assessments. The ratings are more relevant for your decision. Review 1 has a moderate rating of 3, which means that the technical flaws and incomplete details of the proposed method are significant enough to warrant rejection. Review 2 has the lowest rating of 2, which suggests that the major technical flaws and poor evaluation outweigh even the clever formulation of the approximation in section 2. Review 3 has a rating of 4, which indicates that the paper is technically solid, but the reasons to reject, such as limited evaluation, outweigh the reasons to accept, such as good evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Based on this information, I think I will reject the paper.

Dialogue agent: Understood. Please note that as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. My role is simply to provide you with information about the paper's reviews.
