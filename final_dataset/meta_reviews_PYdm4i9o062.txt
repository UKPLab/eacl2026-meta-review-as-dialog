Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "Peephole Steering: Speed Limitation Models for Steering Performance in Restricted View Sizes" and I'm trying to decide whether to accept or reject it. Can you tell me about the paper type and what the paper is proposing?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper is classified as long and proposes a statistical model for steering control in restricted visibility settings.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 mentions that the paper is well-written and well-structured but has a few points of clarification. Can you tell me more about these points and whether they are important?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 suggests that more examples of occluded steering scenarios occurring in practice would strengthen the presentation. The reviewer also requests more elaboration on the choices made in the experiment and the contextualization of the results. Finally, the reviewer suggests drawing more implications for designers. While these points may be important, I am not able to provide an opinion or recommendation on them.

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 seems to be in favor of accepting the paper, but also mentions some weaknesses and limitations. Can you tell me more about these and how they might affect the overall evaluation of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 notes that the proposed model is focused on a niche use case that may not be common in everyday interaction with computing systems. The reviewer suggests removing some of the examples provided that are not relevant to this use case. Review 2 also suggests that the reporting of experimental results could be improved by including post-hoc tests. These weaknesses and limitations may have some impact on the overall evaluation of the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Finally, Review 3 also seems to be in favor of accepting the paper, but mentions some areas that require clarification. Can you tell me more about these areas and whether they are significant?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 requests clarification on some parts of the paper such as the claim made in related work that is not backed up, the use of two different models to estimate movement time, the choice of some experimental parameters, and unexplained data trends. Review 3 also suggests limiting the scope of the paper to what was actually tested in the study. While these areas may require clarification, I am not able to provide an opinion or recommendation on their significance. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Can you tell me about the ratings and confidences mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Review 1 has given a rating of 8, which suggests that the paper is in the top 50% of accepted papers and should be accepted. Review 1 is also fairly confident in their evaluation with a confidence score of 3. Review 2 has given a rating of 6, which suggests that the paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold. Review 2 is fairly confident in their evaluation with a confidence score of 3. Review 3 has also given a rating of 6, which suggests that the paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold. However, Review 3 is more confident in their evaluation with a confidence score of 4.
