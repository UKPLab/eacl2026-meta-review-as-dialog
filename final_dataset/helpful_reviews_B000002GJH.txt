Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in buying Temple Of The Dog but I don't know much about it. Can you tell me more about the album?

Dialogue agent: Of course, Temple Of The Dog is a tribute album to Andrew Wood by Chris Cornell and other members of sound garden. It features soulful and bluesy guitar solos in "Say Hello To Heaven" and "Call Me A Dog" and an 11 minute track called "Reach Down." The album has received critical acclaim for its originality, spontaneity, and authenticity.

Buyer: That's interesting, but I want to know if the album is worth the money.

Dialogue agent: Well, that depends on your taste in music. Reviews have stated that this album is one of the most important and a must-have for grunge fans. It showcases the ability of the Seattle supergroup to rock and demonstrates the debt grunge owes metal. The album is a touching tribute to their lost friend and the powerful music that came from the loss will help keep Mr. Wood's spirit alive. 

Buyer: That sounds great, but how accessible is the album for someone who's not into grunge?

Dialogue agent: The album isn't slick, but it's brilliantly arranged and produced. The sound on this album is unique, and the songs are well written. Some tracks address addiction, and others have a funkier edge. It offers some beautiful rhythms and catchy hooks. There are some heavy topics and themes, but they're accompanied by some fantastic rhythms. 

Buyer: I play the guitar, is this album good for jamming?

Dialogue agent: Yes, it's good for jamming, especially if you play the guitar. There are some great guitar solos and riffs to work with, and the album's bluesy style complements Cornell's singing very well. A lot of reviewers have stated that the band wrote more material and it eventually grew to a full jam session. 

Buyer: I think I'm convinced. I'll buy the album.

Dialogue agent: Great choice. You won't be disappointed with the intricate, refined music and vocalization it offers. The musicianship is rich, and Cornell gives it all he's got. This album is a true collector's piece and will not disappoint any grunge fan.
