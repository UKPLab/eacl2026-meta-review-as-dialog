 Sure, I'd be happy to help! As a dialogue agent, I'll do my best to provide a summary of the reviews and assist the meta-reviewer in making a final decision.

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "High-dimensional limit theorems for SGD: Effective dynamics and critical scaling." Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper studies the high-dimensional limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with constant step-size and obtains an ODE/SDE type of limiting dynamics for the trajectory of a given finite set of summary statistics when the dimension of the data and the parameters go to infinity. The authors also develop a separate SDE for the rescaled summary statistics around a fixed point of the unscaled ballistic dynamics.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the main theorem and its contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The main theorem states that the dynamics of the summary statistics converge to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a deterministic correction term and a diffusion term. The theorem applies to a wide range of learning problems and provides a precise characterization of the dynamics in the form of an SDE.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, in your opinion?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has several strengths, including its technical solidity, high impact on at least one sub-area, and excellent evaluation, resources, and reproducibility. However, the paper's terseness may be a weakness, as it does not provide much intuition about the main theorem or its proof. Additionally, the paper does not provide a constructive way to choose the summary statistics for a given problem of interest.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on your assessment, I will consider the paper's technical solidity, impact, and reproducibility when making my final decision. Do you have any further questions or concerns?

Dialogue Agent: No, that's all. Thank you for the opportunity to assist you!

Meta-reviewer: Thank you! I'll make my final decision based on the information you've provided and my own evaluation of the paper.
