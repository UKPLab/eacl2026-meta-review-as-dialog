 Sure! Here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Learning Self-Imitating Diverse Policies":

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Learning Self-Imitating Diverse Policies" and I have some questions about the method. Can you help me understand the core idea of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a method to improve reinforcement learning for tasks with sparse rewards signals. The basic idea is to select the best episodes from the system's experience, and learn to imitate them step by step as the system evolves, aiming at providing a less sparse learning signal.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the experiments and how they were conducted?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper describes experiments on several MuJoCo tasks, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the learning of policies. The experiments were conducted using a replay buffer to store past experiences, and the proposed method was applied to the experiences in the buffer.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the limitations of the proposed method, as mentioned in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper highlights the limitations of the proposed method, including the fact that it relies on the fact that a good trajectory has at least been encountered once in the past to be of any use, and that it may not be fair to compare the proposed method to on-policy methods.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: I understand. Can you tell me more about the choice of benchmark tasks and how they were selected?

Dialogue Agent: The paper uses MuJoCo tasks as benchmarks, and the choice of tasks was based on the availability of tasks with sparse rewards. The authors suggest that a full suite of tasks would be needed to understand the side effects of the proposed ideas.

Turn 5:
Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. Can you tell me more about the proposed extension to address the limitations of the method, as mentioned in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper proposes an extension based on Stein variational policy gradients to diversify behavior of an ensemble of policies that are learned together. This extension aims to address the limitations of the proposed method by using off-policy information.

Turn 6:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on my understanding of the paper, I would rate it as "clear accept" with a confidence of 4. The paper seems to meet the threshold of publication and provides a notable improvement for sparse-rewards tasks. However, I would like to see more comparisons to other methods and a full suite of tasks to fully understand the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback! Based on your ratings and comments, I can provide more information on the proposed method and its limitations, as well as suggest additional experiments to further validate the results.
