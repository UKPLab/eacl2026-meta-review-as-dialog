Decision Maker: Is it true that Russia is a marginal power?

Dialogue Agent: There are arguments for both sides. Some say that Russia is not entirely a marginal power, while others argue that it is more or less accurate to say that it is.

Decision Maker: Can you explain the argument for Russia not being a marginal power?

Dialogue Agent: The argument is that Putin has become extraordinarily powerful at the expense of the Russian people and at the expense of the Russian nation. In other words, while Russia may not have the same level of influence as other major powers, it is still a significant force in the world.

Decision Maker: And what about the argument that Russia is a marginal power?

Dialogue Agent: The argument against is that during the past crisis, Russia was not able to project what would happen day by day. Even leaders like Vaclav Havel were astonished by the speed of events unfolding. Peter Hitchens, a well-known columnist and author who has spent a lot of time thinking about and living in Russia, holds this view and has written about it extensively.

Decision Maker: So, which side wins?

Dialogue Agent: As a neutral dialogue agent, I cannot express an opinion or make a decision. I can only present the arguments from both sides and leave it to you to reach a conclusion.
