Buyer: That sounds interesting. Are there any particular tracks that stand out?

Dialogue Agent: Some of the most raved-about compositions on the CD include Spectres in the Fog, A Way of Life, and Safe Passage. However, I cannot provide an opinion on these as my responses are based solely on reviews.
