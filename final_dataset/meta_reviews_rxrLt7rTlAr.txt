Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have reviewed the reviews for "Fair Wrapping for Black-box Predictions" and I would like to discuss my decision with you, the dialogue agent.

Dialogue agent: Sure, I'm happy to assist. What are your thoughts on the paper?

Meta-reviewer: Well, one reviewer gave a rating of 6, stating that the paper is technically solid and has moderate-to-high impact with no major concerns. Another reviewer gave a rating of 4, stating that while the paper is technically solid, its weaknesses such as clarity issues and unrealistic assumptions outweigh its strengths. What do you make of this?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper is technically sound but there are issues with presentation and clarity. The unrealistic assumptions could also be a concern.

Meta-reviewer: Yes, I agree. The paper proposes a post-processing mechanism to wrap black-box predictors for fairness, using $\alpha$-trees. One reviewer pointed out that the paper has a number of clarity issues, particularly with the definitions and results. They also highlighted that some assumptions might be unrealistic.

Dialogue agent: That's a valid concern. It's important for a paper to be clear and easy to understand for it to be impactful.

Meta-reviewer: Another reviewer pointed out that the paper is hard to read and the mathematical presentation almost hides the conceptual approach. They also found the evaluation section hard to read.

Dialogue agent: It's important for a paper to have a clear and well-structured presentation for readers to follow the research.

Meta-reviewer: Yes, I agree. Based on the reviews, it seems the paper has strengths in proposing a method to adjust the outputs of any black-box model to be compatible with a desired fairness goal, and in providing a solid theoretical analysis with guarantees obtainable from the proposed algorithm. However, its weaknesses, such as clarity issues and unresolved practical limitations, need to be addressed.

Dialogue agent: That sounds reasonable. As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but I can provide information based on the reviews.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as a borderline reject with a rating of 4. While the paper is technically sound, it has limitations that outweigh its strengths.

Dialogue agent: Thank you for your assessment. I hope this dialogue was helpful in your decision-making process.
