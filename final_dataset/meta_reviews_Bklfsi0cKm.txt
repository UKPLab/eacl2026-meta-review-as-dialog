Meta-reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, I am reviewing a paper titled "Deep Convolutional Networks as shallow Gaussian Processes". It is a long paper and has received three reviews. Can you provide me with an overview of the reviews and the paper's strengths and weaknesses?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper explores the relationship between convolutional neural networks and Gaussian processes and provides a computationally tractable approach to compute the corresponding GP kernel. Review 1 praises the idea of the close relation between certain types of neural networks and GPs and the authors' suggestion that kernels based on convolutional networks might be more practical compared to the ones based on fully connected networks. However, Review 1 also highlights two issues: the theoretical justification provided is a heuristic argument and not a theorem, and the practical applicability of the kernel obtained is limited due to high computational complexity. Review 2 finds the paper to make a significant contribution, with the only suggestion being to include a more thorough discussion of the results. On the other hand, Review 3 points out some deficiencies in the paper. Firstly, the model setting for classification and consequent evaluation on the MNIST dataset lacks probabilistic estimates and proper objective function. Secondly, the paper is not scalable to large datasets, and no theoretical analysis is done.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Given the reviews, what is your recommendation for accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide a recommendation or opinion on accepting or rejecting the paper. However, I can provide you with the ratings and the confidence of the reviews to help you make an informed decision. Review 1 has rated the paper as "marginally below acceptance threshold" with a confidence of "absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature". Review 2 has rated the paper as "top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept" with a confidence of "fairly confident that the evaluation is correct". Review 3 has rated the paper as "marginally below acceptance threshold" with a confidence of "confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct".

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. It appears that the paper has some strengths but also some weaknesses, and the reviews are mixed. Given the limited practical applicability and deficiencies pointed out in Review 3, I would like to see the author's response to those concerns and their plans for future work. Can you please provide me with the contact information for the corresponding author?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the corresponding author's email address is provided in the paper. I will send it to your email so that you can contact them directly.
