 Sure, here is a dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Brax - A Differentiable Physics Engine for Large Scale Rigid Body Simulation":

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm evaluating a paper titled "Brax - A Differentiable Physics Engine for Large Scale Rigid Body Simulation". Can you help me understand the key contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes Brax, a differentiable physics engine for large scale rigid body simulation. The engine is designed to provide a strong alternative for solving robotics control tasks like locomotion and manipulation.

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the differentiability of the engine?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper highlights the differentiability of the engine as one of its main advantages. The engine is designed to be differentiable, allowing for more accurate and efficient training of reinforcement learning algorithms.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you tell me about the experiments conducted in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper re-implements three MuJoCo locomotion tasks and two additional manipulation & locomotion tasks to demonstrate the correctness and utility of the engine. It also compares the engine with the traditional MuJoCo physics engine to validate its correctness.

Meta-Reviewer: That's good to know. What about the limitations of the engine?

Dialogue Agent: The paper does mention some limitations of the engine, such as the need for more extensive experimental support and a lack of comparisons to previous infrastructures. However, the authors do provide a well-organized and well-documented codebase on Github.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews, I'm considering the paper for acceptance. Can you tell me more about the confidence of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Based on the reviews, the reviewers have a fairly high confidence in the correctness of the evaluation, with a rating of 7 and a confidence of 3. However, one reviewer does mention some limitations of the paper, such as a lack of comparisons to previous works and a need for more experimental support.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. I will consider the paper based on the reviews and my own evaluation.
