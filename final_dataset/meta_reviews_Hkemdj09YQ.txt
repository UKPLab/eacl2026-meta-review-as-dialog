 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper, based on the given reviews:

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper and I have some questions. Can you help me?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I'll do my best to assist you. What's the paper about and what questions do you have?

Meta-reviewer: The paper is titled "Rectified Gradient: Layer-wise Thresholding for Sharp and Coherent Attribution Maps". I have some concerns about the evaluation section and the experimental results. Can you help me understand the method and the results better?

Turn 2:

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I can help you with that! The paper proposes a new method called Rectified Gradient, which is a layer-wise thresholding method to reduce the noise in the attribution maps. The authors claim that the method produces clearer and more coherent attribution maps than existing methods.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, that sounds interesting. But I have some concerns about the evaluation section. The authors only show a few examples of saliency maps and claim that the method produces less noisy gradients. Can you help me understand why the authors think the method is effective?

Turn 3:

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors base their claims on empirical observations about the cause of noisy gradients in deep neural networks. They argue that irrelevant information propagated in the forward pass can cause noisy gradients, and their method filters out these irrelevant passes to produce less noisy gradients. The authors also present some experimental results to support their claims.

Meta-reviewer: I see. But I'm not convinced by the experimental results. The authors only show a few examples of saliency maps and don't provide any quantitative comparisons to existing methods. Can you help me understand why the authors didn't provide more comprehensive experimental results?

Turn 4:

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that the existing quantitative evaluation in the paper seems disconnected to the visual nature of saliency maps, and they suggest that the evaluation should be more focused on the visual quality of the saliency maps. However, they do present some quantitative comparisons in the appendix, which show that Rectified Gradient has a higher sensitivity and ROAR/KAR than existing methods.

Meta-reviewer: Hmm, I see. Well, I'm still not convinced by the experimental results. Can you help me understand why the authors didn't provide more comprehensive experimental results?

Turn 5:

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that the experimental results are less convincing, and they suggest that the evaluation should be more focused on the visual quality of the saliency maps. They also mention that the current manuscript has an inconsistency between the fundamental idea (based on empirical observations) and the performance of Rectified Gradient.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, I think I understand the paper now. Thank you for your help!

Turn 6:

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else you would like to know or discuss?

Meta-reviewer: No, that's all for now. Thank you again!
