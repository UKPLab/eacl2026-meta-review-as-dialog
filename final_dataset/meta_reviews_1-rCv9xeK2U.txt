Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I am reviewing a paper titled "RecXplainer: Post-Hoc Attribute-Based Explanations for Recommender Systems" for a workshop. Can you tell me what the reviewers thought about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, certainly. There were three reviews for the paper. Review 1 stated that the paper addressed a very important problem and proposed novel approaches that made a good contribution to the workshop. Review 2 mentioned that the paper was well-written, clearly motivated the proposed method, and provided useful evaluation metrics. Review 3 noted that the paper was thorough in its introduction and analysis of a new method, although the phrasing of the research questions was a bit convoluted, and some limitations could have been discussed. 

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. Do you know what the ratings and confidence levels were for each review?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 1 gave a rating of 8, with a confidence level of 4. Review 2 also gave a rating of 8, but with a confidence level of 3. Review 3 gave a rating of 7, and a confidence level of 4.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on these reviews, what is your recommendation for acceptance or rejection of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, it is not my place to make recommendations. My role is to provide you with the reviews and ratings, and answer any questions you may have. Ultimately, you as the meta-reviewer must make the decision on acceptance or rejection. 

Meta-reviewer: Right, of course. I am just trying to gauge the overall sentiment of the reviewers and their confidence levels to make an informed decision. Can you tell me more about the type of paper and its contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper is classified as long, and its contributions include a novel post-hoc and model-agnostic method for generating attribute-based explanations for recommender systems, as well as principled evaluation metrics for comparing recommendation explanations.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds like a significant contribution. Do you have any additional insights or information that could help me make a decision?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I do not have any opinions or recommendations. However, it may be worth considering the confidence levels of the reviewers in relation to their ratings. Reviewers 1 and 2 both gave a rating of 8, but Reviewer 1 had a higher confidence level of 4, compared to Reviewer 2's confidence level of 3. Reviewer 3 gave a rating of 7 with a confidence level of 4. 

Meta-reviewer: That is a good point, thank you for reminding me. I will take that into consideration. Based on the reviews, contributions, and my own evaluation, I have decided to accept the paper for the workshop. Thank you for your assistance, Dialogue Agent.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, Meta-reviewer. It was my pleasure to assist you.
