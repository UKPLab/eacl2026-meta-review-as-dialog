Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your reviews of the paper "Answering Science Exam Questions Using Query Reformulation with Background Knowledge." Based on your feedback, I have a few questions and concerns. Review 1, you mentioned that the paper could have included more studies on query reformulations and provided more examples. Could you elaborate on how important this is for the overall evaluation of the paper?

Review 1: Sure. I believe that providing more examples of query reformulations and decision rules can help readers understand better how the model works. It can also be helpful in evaluating the significance and originality of the paper's contributions.

Meta-reviewer: That's a valid point. Review 2, you suggested adding more related work and conducting significance tests. How critical do you think these suggestions are to the final decision of whether to accept or reject the paper?

Review 2: I think they are essential to the peer-review process. Adding more related work can show that the authors have thoroughly researched the field, and conducting significance tests can help assess the impact of the proposed system.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Review 3, you raised concerns about the novelty of the paper and the use of TransH. Could you explain why these are significant issues when deciding whether to accept or reject the paper?

Review 3: The novelty of the paper is important because it shows that the research is advancing the field. If there are no new techniques proposed, it may not be worthy of publication. As for TransH, it is a specific type of knowledge graph embedding, and it is unclear why it was chosen and how it helps the system's performance. This can be a concern for reviewers who may question the validity of the approach.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on your reviews, it seems that the paper has some promising contributions, but there are some areas where more detail or clarification is needed. Review 1 and Review 2, you both have suggested revisions that can enhance the paper's clarity and significance. Review 3, you raised some concerns, but your confidence level in your evaluation is lower than the other reviewers. Given the mixed feedback, I am inclined to lean towards accepting the paper, but I would like to hear your thoughts and any counter-arguments. 

Review 1: I agree that the paper has potential, but it can benefit from more revisions.

Review 2: I think the paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold, but the revisions suggested can improve its quality significantly.

Review 3: I remain concerned about the novelty and the use of TransH, but I agree that the paper has some positive aspects.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on the feedback from the reviewers, I believe the paper can benefit from some revisions and clarifications. Therefore, I will recommend accepting this paper with the condition that the authors address the reviewers' feedback adequately.
