 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "First is Better Than Last for Language Data Influence":

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "First is Better Than Last for Language Data Influence". Can you provide me with a summary of the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper "First is Better Than Last for Language Data Influence" investigates the effectiveness of different parameters serving as data influence measurement. It provides two important insights on the informativeness of parameters in lower layers and the cancellation effect of parameters used by more training examples. Motivated by these insights, it develops a novel data influence method by replacing parameters of the last layer used in TracIn with embedding layer.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper provides two valuable insights: first, the gradients of the embedding weights capture high-level information due to gradient chain, and second, parameters used by more training examples suffer more from 'cancellation effect'. The proposed method takes both low- and high-level similarity into consideration. Additionally, the paper has good writing and clear presentation.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: What about the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has some limitations, such as the terms of 'share logic' and 'unique logic' being vague, and there should be an ablation study for using special tokens only on full dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of word overlap. Removing data points also changes the training process, and there should be control on related variables to be consistent for different methods.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: Based on your summary, how would you rate the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as a 6: Weak Accept. The paper has some limitations, but the technical novelty is moderate to high, and the impact is moderate to high.

Turn 5:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your summary. Based on the reviews and your summary, I agree with your rating. The paper has some valuable insights and contributions, but there are some limitations that need to be addressed.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help you with your review. If you have any further questions or need any additional information, please don't hesitate to ask.
