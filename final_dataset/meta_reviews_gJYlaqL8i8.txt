 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a simulation of a dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper and I have some questions. Can you help me?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I'd be happy to help. What's the paper about and what questions do you have?

Meta-Reviewer: The paper is called "Learning to Sample with Local and Global Contexts in Experience Replay Buffer". I have some questions about the reviews and the paper's type.

Dialogue Agent: Great! I can help you with that. The paper is a long paper, and the reviews are [Review 1:EDIT: The statements about ERO clarify the contribution considerably. 6-->7The authors propose an adaptively sampling mechanism optimized for policy improvement (NERS). By incorporating minibatch-wide information into the sampling score (while maintaining permutation invariance), they are able to out-perform reasonable baselines on a wide range of tasks.While NERS rarely beats other methods decisively, it has a strong showing across continuous and discrete action tasks and with a variety of off-policy learners. However, a few things would strengthen the empirical results. Some notation of spread should be reported on all of the Tables (e.g. standard error). Number of random seeds should also be mentioned. The reasoning behind the task selection should also be made explicit. The Atari subset used here is a bit unusual, particularly the choice to not use frame-skip. Investigating the sampling decisions of NERS is attempted in Figure 4, but further work should be done to provide evidence to the 'diversity of samples' claim. Ideally, NERS wouldn't just trade off TD error and Q-value over time, but also within each batch. Reporting something like the average minibatch Q-value/ TD-error standard deviation on NERS vs other methods would be nice. A qualitative evaluation akin to Figure 1 would also help guide intuition.The off-policy RL related works section is a bit over-long, discussing things like the dueling architecture which don't seem to be overtly related apart from coming from the same sub-field. On the other side of things, having skimmed the ERO paper it is definitely the most-closely related, and as such deserves a bit more time spent on discussing the differences. For example, it is a bit unclear if the two sampling reward functions are different. An uncharitable reading of this paper would be that it is just an architecture tweak on top of ERO, and while the empirical results help dispel this idea, I think a more explicit comparison would still be useful.A related point is that the reward function for the sampler is quite unclear (Equation 6). How are these expectation evaluated in practice? I'd assume it'd just be the difference of value functions before and after the update, but the appendix suggest a more involved computation that doesn't appear to have been made explicit anywhere.Final small point, towards the end a bi-GRU is mentioned as being used and I can't see where that'd come into play. Perhaps just a typo?Overall, I like this paper. Evaluating an idea across a variety of learning algorithms, observation and action spaces is no small feat, and the results are very solid. With a few tweaks and explanations this would be a very strong paper. |||| rating: 7: Good paper, accept |||| confidence: 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct].
