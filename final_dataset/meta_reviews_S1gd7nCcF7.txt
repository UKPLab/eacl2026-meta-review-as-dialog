Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "Self-Supervised Generalisation with Meta Auxiliary Learning". Can you give me an overview of the paper's contributions and strengths?

Dialogue agent: Sure. The paper proposes a technique for auxiliary learning, where external training data is used to improve learning on a target prediction task. The authors propose a heuristic for learning from both data sets through minimization of a joint loss function. The paper's strength lies in proposing a new auxiliary learning algorithm and showing positive results on the CIFAR data set.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 1 notes that the novelty is low and there is no theoretical insight into the performance of the algorithm. What do you have to say about that?

Dialogue agent: I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but I can tell you that Review 1 also notes that the problem assumptions are too simplistic and unrealistic. Additionally, the experiments are performed using a synthetic setup on a single data set, so it remains unclear if the algorithm would be successful in a real-life scenario.

Meta-reviewer: Hmm, I see. Review 2 is critical of the paper's claims and makes several points about the experiments, including a lack of comparisons to several important baselines from self-supervised learning community. Can you explain how the authors responded to these points?

Dialogue agent: I am sorry, but I cannot provide information regarding the author's response. My understanding is based solely on the reviews and the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Fair enough. Lastly, Review 3 notes that the paper is well written and easy to read, with a novel idea of applying meta-learning to automatic generation of auxiliary tasks. However, the performance gain is not substantial. How does the paper respond to this criticism?

Dialogue agent: Again, I cannot provide information regarding the author's response, but Review 3 suggests that the authors use the state-of-the-art classifier for the principal task and evaluate how much gain the proposed method can get with the help of auxiliary tasks. Additionally, if the information on the hierarchy of sub-categories is not available, it will be an annoying hyperparameter that should be well tuned.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Given these reviews, I am still uncertain whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you tell me the confidence levels of each reviewer?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 rated their confidence level as 3, which means they are fairly confident that the evaluation is correct. Review 2 rated their confidence level as 4, which means they are confident but not absolutely certain. Review 3 rated their confidence level as 4 as well.

Meta-reviewer: Alright, thank you. I will carefully consider these reviews and make a decision.
