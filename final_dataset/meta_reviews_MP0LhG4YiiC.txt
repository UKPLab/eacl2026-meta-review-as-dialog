 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper. The title of the paper is "Analogical Reasoning for Visually Grounded Compositional Generalization". The type of the paper is long. The reviews are [Review 1:Summary:This paper explores the problem of generalizing to novel combinations of verbs and nouns in a task for captioning video stills from videos about cooking. The paper introduces a new dataset based off of EPIC-Kitchens (Damen et al. 2018) which masks out verbs and nouns and splits the evaluation data into seen combinations of verb/noun pairs and unseen combinations of verb/noun pairs, challenging a model to generate captions for pairs which were not seen during training. The paper also proposed a model, ARTNet, to address this task. The model works by first finding nearest neighbor examples in the training data that are similar in (masked) caption and image, then embedding these similar examples into an "analogical embedding", which is used to condition a network that fills in the masked verb and noun in the target example. The reviewer has some concerns about the dataset's construction and suggestions for additional experiments. Strengths include the proposed model's performance and the baselines. Weaknesses include the missing citations for compositional reasoning on novel images/visual contexts, the potential non-determinism in the results, and the lack of ablation. The meta-reviewer may ask follow-up questions, and their final decision will involve weighing the importance of reviewer confidence.

Dialogue:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm a meta-reviewer for a paper titled "Analogical Reasoning for Visually Grounded Compositional Generalization". Can you help me with the review process?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I'd be happy to assist you. What specific questions or concerns do you have about the paper?

Meta-Reviewer: Well, I have some concerns about the dataset's construction and the lack of ablation in the paper. Can you help me understand these aspects better?

Dialogue Agent: Sure thing! Let me address each of your concerns. Firstly, the dataset, EPIC-Kitchens, was constructed by masking out verbs and nouns in the training data, and splitting the evaluation data into seen and unseen combinations of verb/noun pairs. This allows the model to generalize to novel combinations of verbs and nouns, which is the main goal of the paper.

Regarding the lack of ablation, the paper does not include ablation studies to compare the performance of the proposed model, ARTNet, with and without the analogical reasoning component. However, the authors do mention that the model performs well on the proposed task and that the baselines are strong.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for clarifying those points. I still have some concerns about the dataset's construction. For example, the paper does not provide any information about the distribution of the verbs and nouns in the training data, or how the masking of verbs and nouns was done. Can you help me understand this better?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The distribution of verbs and nouns in the training data is not explicitly discussed in the paper, but it is worth noting that the dataset is based on EPIC-Kitchens (Damen et al. 2018), which is a dataset of video captions for cooking videos. The masking of verbs and nouns is done in a way that ensures that the model is challenged to generalize to novel combinations of verbs and nouns.


Regarding the masking process, the authors do not provide explicit details on how the masking was done, but it is worth noting that the authors do mention that the masking was done "carefully" which suggests that the authors took care in selecting the masking process.
