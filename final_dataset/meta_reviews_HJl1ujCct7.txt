Meta-reviewer: Hi, I have reviewed the reviews of the paper "A Multi-modal one-class generative adversarial network for anomaly detection in manufacturing" and I would like to have a dialogue with you to discuss the paper's strengths and weaknesses.

Dialogue agent: Hello, I am here to answer your questions to the best of my abilities based on the reviews and type of paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Review 1 states that the paper is not clear and reproducible enough for the reviewer to recommend its acceptance. Can you elaborate on this?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 points out several issues related to the experiment design and methodology that make it difficult to reproduce and validate the results. For example, the paper presents results on a single private dataset without any indication that the dataset will be shared with the community. The paper also lacks details about the architecture of the pre-trained, domain-specific feature extractor. Additionally, the way the complementary distribution is defined is not specific enough, which raises concerns about the efficacy of the method.

Meta-reviewer: I see. This seems like a significant issue. However, Review 2 mentions that the paper's idea is interesting. What can you tell me about this?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 agrees that the general idea of the paper, which is to use a multi-modal one-class generative adversarial network for anomaly detection, is interesting. However, Review 2 points out several issues with the paper, such as the enormous number of misprints, mistakes in the text, and mistakes in formulas, which make the paper hard to understand. Review 2 also notes that the paper only considers one proprietary dataset, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the approach.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 3 seems to appreciate the technical soundness of the paper. Can you provide more details about this?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Review 3 agrees that the article is technically sound. The reviewers find the math reasonable, although some notations are a bit hard to follow. The paper uses Complementary GAN to generate samples in the low-density areas of the data distribution, which the discriminator can then be used to classify as either real or anomalous. Review 3 appreciates the use of a categorical latent variable to force the model to map different modes of the data, but also notes that the approach is not novel and that no citations are provided. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on these reviews, it seems that the paper has some significant weaknesses, such as the lack of reproducibility and clarity issues. On the other hand, there are some positive aspects, such as the interesting idea and technical soundness. Considering the type of the paper and the confidence levels of the reviews, what rating would you assign to the paper?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews and the type of the paper, I would assign a rating of 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection. Although the paper has some interesting aspects, the lack of reproducibility and clarity issues are significant concerns that cannot be overlooked. Additionally, the paper's results are limited to one proprietary dataset, and the generalizability of the approach is unknown.
