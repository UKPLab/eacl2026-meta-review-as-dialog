Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in the Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L II USM Ultra Wide Angle Zoom Lens. Can you tell me more about it?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! This is a great lens for landscapes and nighttime and low-light photography. It includes a fast aperture of f/2.8, which will allow you to shoot in very tight spaces without moving back.

Buyer: How is the sharpness of this lens?

Dialogue Agent: The sharpness of this lens is typical L class optics and great construction. It is very sharp throughout its focal range.

Buyer: Do you have information about the vignetting of this lens?

Dialogue Agent: The vignetting disappears when stopping down to smaller f-stops. This lens is just too amazing! If you can spend the extra money, I recommend this lens.

Buyer: Is this lens weather-proof and sturdy?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the professional build and weather-proofing and sturdiness are unmatched in its category. Also, it's fully weather-sealed to protect against dust and moisture.

Buyer: How is the autofocus of this lens?

Dialogue Agent: The autofocus is fast and on point every time, even with a low aperture.

Buyer: Can this lens take good photos for indoor shots and street photography?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, it is great for weddings, street photography, and indoor shots, too. However, it is definitely not ideal for a walkaround lens, and the 24-70 would be better for full frame while the 17-55 would be a much better.

Buyer: Are there any downsides to this lens?

Dialogue Agent: The only downfall to this lens is the simple fact that it warps the image at wide-open. Also, if you are too close, the distortion can be very ugly and drastic. 

Buyer: Can you tell me if this lens comes with any accessories?

Dialogue Agent: I’m sorry, but there isn’t a lens bag accompanying it. However, it does come with a nice pouch to protect it will pull strings at the top and can work well as a walk-around lens.

Buyer: Thank you for all the information. I have decided to buy this lens.
