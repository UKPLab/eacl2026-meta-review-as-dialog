Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Learning Joint Wasserstein Auto-Encoders for Joint Distribution Matching." Based on the reviews, I have a few questions and concerns before making a decision. Can you clarify some things for me?

Dialogue agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. I'll do my best to answer your questions without providing opinions or recommendations.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. First, can you explain the problem the paper is addressing and its proposed solution?

Dialogue agent: The paper addresses the joint distribution matching problem where one aims to learn a bi-directional mapping between unpaired data elements in two different domains using the joint Wasserstein auto-encoder (JWAE) method. Instead of finding a coupling, the paper seeks a decoupling to make the primal problem of Wasserstein distance tractable. This decoupled version of joint Wasserstein distance is used for empirical reconstruction losses of within-domain auto-encodings and cyclic mappings. Two GAN divergences are used to learn the cross-domain mappings so that the generated distributions are close to the real distribution, and another GAN divergence is imposed to align the latent distributions generated by two auto-encoders.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 1 mentioned that the paper is poorly written with many typos and errors. Can you address this concern?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the authors addressed this concern in the rebuttal and revised their paper accordingly. The final version of the paper has improved readability and addressed the issues mentioned in Review 1.

Meta-reviewer: Good to know. Review 2 mentioned that the paper could have applied the proposed relaxed optimal Wasserstein distance to VAE and GAN losses. Can you comment on this?

Dialogue agent: While the proposed relaxed Wasserstein distance was used for Auto-Encoder and cycle consistency losses, the authors did not extend it to the distribution divergence as well. It is possible that applying it to distributions other than those in the paper would affect the results, but the authors did not explore this possibility.

Meta-reviewer: Lastly, Review 3 mentioned that the paper lacked comparison with Bicycle-GAN and did not discuss the use of MMD and other methods mentioned in the original WAE paper. Can you comment on this as well?

Dialogue agent: Review 3's concerns are valid, and the authors did not address them in the rebuttal or the revised paper. They could have compared their method with Bicycle-GAN and discussed the use of MMD and other methods. However, it is up to the reviewers to decide how important these omissions are in determining the paper's acceptance.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses, dialogue agent. Based on the reviews and your clarifications, I am still uncertain about the paper's acceptance. I will need to review the paper myself to make a final decision.
