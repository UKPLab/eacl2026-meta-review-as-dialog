Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you summarize the main points of the three reviews for the paper "Coupled Recurrent Models for Polyphonic Music Composition", which is a long paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, certainly. Review 1 concludes that the paper is clear and reliable, but raises concerns about the level of musical training of the participants in the qualitative experiment. Review 2, on the other hand, strongly recommends for the paper's rejection due to poor technical writing, particularly the unclear description of the models. Review 3 suggests that the paper makes reasonable choices, but suffers from poor writing organization and lacks originality or significance for the approach in polyphonic music generation.

Meta-reviewer: Thanks. Review 1 seems positive, but I am concerned about the lack of information about controlling for musical ability. Review 3 seems to have some reservations, but has positive comments about the evaluation. However, Review 2 strongly recommends rejection due to poor technical writing. Can you clarify how reviewers rated the paper?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 rated the paper 7 and has a confidence level of 3 in its evaluation. Review 2 rated the paper 3 and has a confidence level of 4 in its evaluation. Review 3 rated the paper 4 and has a confidence level of 4 in its evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews, I am inclined to reject the paper as suggested by Review 2. However, I am also curious about the evaluation from Review 1 and the positive results from Review 3. Can you provide more information about the paper's type and the confidence levels of the reviews?

Dialogue agent: The paper is a long paper, and its type is not specified further. Review 1 has a confidence level of 3, suggesting a relatively moderate level of confidence. Review 2 has a confidence level of 4, indicating a relatively high level of confidence. Review 3 also has a confidence level of 4, which is also a relatively high level of confidence.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Despite the positive results from Review 1 and Review 3, I am concerned about the technical writing issues raised in Review 2 and the lack of originality mentioned in Review 3. Therefore, I will follow the recommendation of Review 2 and reject the paper. Thank you for your help.
