 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Transformer-XL: Language Modeling with Longer-Term Dependency":

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Transformer-XL: Language Modeling with Longer-Term Dependency". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Based on the reviews provided, the paper proposes a variant of transformer to train language models with longer-term dependency. The reviews mention that the paper has achieved significant perplexity reduction on WikiText-103 corpus, but the reviewer is uncertain about the evaluation being correct.

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. What are the pros and cons of the proposed model, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: The reviews mention that the proposed model has several pros, such as its ability to capture long-range contextual relations and its well-organized and well-written structure. However, the reviews also mention that the model is ad-hoc and is only compatible with language model tasks, and that there are some minor issues with the writing and the absence of a popular language model benchmark.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What is the rating and confidence level of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the rating is marginally above acceptance threshold (6) and the confidence level is 4, indicating that the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and the ratings, I will consider the paper for acceptance or rejection.

Dialogue Agent: Of course! Is there anything else I can help with?

Meta-reviewer: No, that's all for now. Thank you for your assistance!

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any further help.
