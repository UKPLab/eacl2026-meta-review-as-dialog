 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Generative Code Modeling with Graphs":

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Generative Code Modeling with Graphs". Can you tell me what this paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a novel approach to generative code modeling using graph neural networks. The authors represent programs as graphs and use a grammar-driven decoder to sequentially generate the AST and the corresponding program.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper addresses a challenging problem in the field of programming languages, and the proposed approach is a novel and successful attempt to incorporate the structure information of the program into neural networks. The results are also very promising, with the proposed method achieving better predictive performance compared to several recent works.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: What are the weaknesses of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper could benefit from providing more statistics of the proposed dataset, such as the average number of tokens and the average size of ASTs. Additionally, the authors could provide more information on the efficiency of the proposed method and compare the log likelihood on the test set. Finally, it is unclear from the paper whether the authors use a pre-trained GGNN as encoder or train the encoder end-to-end with the decoder from scratch.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I think this paper has made a great progress towards neural modelling of programs and I would recommend it to be accepted for ICLR.

Dialogue Agent: I agree with the reviewer's assessment. The paper has made a significant contribution to the field and the proposed approach has the potential to inspire other machine learning-based programming applications.

Output:
The meta-reviewer recommends accepting the paper for ICLR, with a confidence level of 7 (good paper, accept) and a rating of 7 (good paper, accept). The dialogue agent provides summarized answers based on the reviews, refraining from opinions or recommendations.
