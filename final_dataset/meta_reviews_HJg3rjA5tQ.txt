Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Thank you for being here. I have read the reviews for the paper "Spread Divergences", and I have some questions that will help me decide whether or not to accept the paper. Can you answer them for me?

Dialogue Agent: Of course, Meta-Reviewer. I will do my best to provide you with accurate information.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, let's start with Review 1. The reviewer points out several issues with the paper's writing and notation, as well as some questions about the relevance of certain sections. Can you confirm or deny these issues and provide any further explanations?

Dialogue Agent: I can confirm that Review 1 raises important concerns about the writing and notation of the paper. While I can't provide opinions or recommendations, I can say that the authors may want to consider revising the paper to address these concerns. In terms of the relevance of certain sections, I can only state that the paper's type is long, so it is possible for there to be some overlap between sections.

Meta-Reviewer: Fair enough. Now, Review 2 brings up some serious criticisms about the paper's lack of formal results and attention to state of the art comparisons. What is your take on this?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 raises valid concerns about the paper's lack of formal results and comparisons to state of the art methods. Again, I can't provide opinions or recommendations, but the authors may want to take these criticisms into consideration when revising the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: I understand. Finally, Review 3 praises the paper's introduction of spread divergences and its application to various examples. However, the reviewer also suggests more empirical results would have strengthened the paper. What is your response to this?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 provides positive feedback about the paper's introduction of spread divergences and its examples. In terms of the suggestion for more empirical results, the authors may want to consider this feedback when revising the paper. However, I can't provide specific recommendations or opinions.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses, Dialogue Agent. Based on these reviews, how confident are you in recommending the acceptance or rejection of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: I cannot provide opinions or recommendations on whether to accept or reject the paper. However, I can say that Review 1 and Review 2 both rate the paper below the acceptance threshold, while Review 3 rates the paper marginally above. The meta-reviewer may want to consider the various criticisms and positive feedback when making a decision.
