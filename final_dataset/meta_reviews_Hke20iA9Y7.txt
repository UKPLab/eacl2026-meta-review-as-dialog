 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Efficient Training on Very Large Corpora via Gramian Estimation":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Efficient Training on Very Large Corpora via Gramian Estimation". Can you tell me what this paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper presents a novel method for training neural embedding models on very large corpora using Gramian estimation. The proposed method is efficient and achieves better quality than existing methods.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper presents two algorithms for training the model, SAGram and SOGram, which reduce the variance in the Grammian estimates and result in faster convergence and better generalization. The paper also evaluates the proposed method on several benchmark tasks and shows improved performance compared to existing methods.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the evaluation in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper evaluates the proposed method on several benchmark tasks, including word embedding and recommendation tasks. The evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves better performance than existing methods on these tasks. However, one reviewer notes that the evaluation may be weak and does not fully support the claims made in the paper.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are your thoughts on the evaluation in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I do not have personal opinions or biases. However, I can provide a summary of the reviews and the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. The paper presents a novel method for training neural embedding models on very large corpora using Gramian estimation, and the proposed method achieves better performance than existing methods on several benchmark tasks. However, the evaluation in the paper may be weak and does not fully support the claims made in the paper.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your summary. Based on the reviews and your summary, I will consider the paper for acceptance. However, I would like to see more evaluation and validation of the proposed method on other tasks and datasets to fully support the claims made in the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Understood. Thank you for your feedback. I will pass on your comments to the authors for their consideration.
