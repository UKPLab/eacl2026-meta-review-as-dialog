 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Guided Evolutionary Strategies: Escaping the Curse of Dimensionality in Random Search". The reviews are [Review 1, Review 2, and Review 3]. The meta-reviewer is aware only of the paper's title and relies on the dialogue agent, equipped with reviews and paper type information, to make a final decision. The output should feature only the dialogue, without duplicated sentences, and the dialogue agent should present answers in a summarized form without bullet points.

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi, I'm considering a paper titled "Guided Evolutionary Strategies: Escaping the Curse of Dimensionality in Random Search". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a method called Guided Evolutionary Strategies (GES) that combines random search with a surrogate gradient information to escape the curse of dimensionality. The authors also analyze the bias-variance trade-off of the method and provide results on several benchmark functions.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the reviewers saying about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the three reviews provided, Review 1 mentions that the authors propose an approach that combines random search with the surrogate gradient information, but the analysis assumes that the gradient exists. Review 2 states that the paper lacks clarity and is hard to follow, and the method could have been better illustrated. Review 3 suggests that the paper is in the right direction but is not yet there in terms of writing quality.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Thanks for summarizing the reviews. What is the author's take on the relationship between their method and quasi-Newton methods?

Dialogue Agent: According to the authors, their method is similar to (stochastic) quasi-Newton methods, as they also use a rank-one update of the gradient. However, the authors note that their method is more efficient and scalable than traditional quasi-Newton methods.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful to know. How does the paper address the issue of high-dimensional optimization?

Dialogue Agent: The paper addresses the issue of high-dimensional optimization by building a subspace of the previous k surrogate gradients and mixing it with an isotropic Gaussian distribution to improve the search. The authors also provide results on several benchmark functions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: I see. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, according to the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewers praise the paper's originality and the authors' ability to deal with optimization in high-dimensional space. However, the reviewers also mention that the paper lacks clarity and is hard to follow, and that the method could have been better illustrated. Additionally, one reviewer notes that the paper does not adapt the covariance matrix and use an external information to guide the distribution, which is a difference from other related works.

Turn 6:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews and your dialogue, I have decided to [insert decision here]. Thank you for your help!

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I'm glad I could assist you in making your decision. If you have any further questions or need additional help, please don't hesitate to ask.
