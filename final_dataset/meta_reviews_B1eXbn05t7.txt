Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "Open-Ended Content-Style Recombination Via Leakage Filtering" and would like to ask some questions to clarify some points. To start, can you tell me what the type of paper is and the main idea behind it?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, the paper is a long paper and the main idea behind it is to propose a VAE-based method for open-ended content-style recombination. The authors aim to separate the styles and content of images by using leakage filtering to enable open-ended recombination.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that. Review 1 suggested that the authors should include an analysis of the time complexity of the proposed method. Is there any mention of this in the paper?

Dialogue agent: I am afraid that I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that the authors did not include any mention of time complexity in the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Review 2 commented on the lack of comparison to prior work on generation results and the limited discussion comparing the proposed methods to other published alternatives. Are there any references to other papers on similar topics in this paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the authors did include some references to prior work in the paper. However, it is up to the meta-reviewer to judge whether the authors conducted enough comparisons to other proposed methods.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Moving on to Review 3, the reviewer raised concerns about the relationship between this work and previous work on style transfer. Can you tell me more about this?

Dialogue agent: The reviewer mentioned that previous work on style transfer already addressed the issue of generalization to novel content classes in a more universal way. The reviewer also suggested that the authors should have compared their proposed method to these existing methods.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the explanation. Lastly, Review 3 also asked about the last term of L_{LF} and how it is computed. Is there any mention of this in the paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper provides a formula for the last term of L_{LF} in equation (4). It is calculated based on the cosine similarity between the two sets of codes and the threshold value determined for each set.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for answering my questions. Given the reviews, do you have any recommendations on whether to accept or reject this paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I can only provide information and cannot make any decisions or recommendations. The decision is up to the meta-reviewer to make based on their assessment of the reviews and the quality of the paper.
