Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you summarize the main points of the reviews for me?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. Review 1 gives a high rating of 7 and is fairly confident in their evaluation of the paper, praising its approach, motivation, analysis, and experiments. They recommend discussing the connection to Nesterov's method and putting more theoretical results in the main text. Review 2 gives a slightly lower rating of 6 and is also fairly confident, but less impressed with the novelty of the proposed method and suggests adding theoretical results to the main text along with some clarification. Finally, Review 3 gives a lower rating of 5 but is confident in their evaluation, pointing out some issues with the results and comparing the method to multi-step gradient methods.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on these reviews, what would you say are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue agent: The strengths of the paper include its motivation, analysis, and experiments. The proposed method of aggregated momentum is shown to be more stable than other momentum methods and achieves better performance in auto-encoder and image classification tasks. The theoretical results on the quadratic problem are also a positive aspect. However, some reviewers suggest adding more theoretical results to the main text and clarifying certain details. The method's novelty may also be questioned, and there are concerns about the convincingness of the results.

Meta-reviewer: How confident are the reviewers in their evaluations?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 and Review 2 are both fairly confident, with confidence levels of 3. Review 3 is more confident, with a confidence level of 4.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, thank you. Based on these reviews and what you've told me, I think I will accept the paper. While there are some concerns raised by the reviewers, the method's stability and performance in experiments suggest it is a valuable contribution.
