Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I've read through the reviews for "Domain Generalization with MixStyle" and I'd like to discuss the paper further before making a decision. Dialogue agent, can you start by telling me what type of paper this is and what the proposed method is?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. This is a long paper that proposes a regularization technique for domain generalization tasks called MixStyle. The method is based on the observation that domains are determined by image styles, and by mixing styles of different instances, the proposed method achieves the generalizability of the trained model. The MixStyle was applied to numerous applications, such as category classification, instance retrieval, and reinforcement learning, and attained the state-of-the arts.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Can you also provide me with information about the reviewers' ratings and confidence levels?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. Reviewer 1 rated the paper as a 7, finding it to be a good paper worthy of acceptance, and expressed confidence level of 4 out of 5 -- confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. Reviewer 2 initially rated the paper as a 6, marginally above the acceptance threshold, but adjusted their rating after reading the authors' response and other reviews and expressed a confidence level of 4 out of 5. Reviewer 3 rated the paper as a 7, also finding it to be a good paper worthy of acceptance, with a confidence level of 4 out of 5.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. I see that all reviewers find the paper to be a good one. Can you tell me more about the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 found the method to be simple and effective, with a well-written paper that offers insight into domain shift problems. They did, however, have some minor comments, such as finding it difficult to understand figure 4 and suggesting that the optimal combinations of the MixStyle's application may vary according to applications. Reviewer 2 also found the paper to be well-written and appreciated the experimental analysis, but expressed concerns about the novelty of the method and the limited experimental validation. Reviewer 3, in general, found the paper to be well-written with clear, simple ideas, but also had some concerns, such as the need for more explanation regarding MixUp and the addition of an explanation for the suffix "_x."

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. I have one additional question. Can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. All three reviewers expressed a confidence level of 4 out of 5 -- confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. Reviewer 2 initially rated the paper as a 6 but adjusted their rating after reading the authors' response and other reviews, indicating an increase in confidence. However, none of the reviewers expressed absolute certainty about their evaluations.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviewers' comments, it seems like there are some minor concerns but overall, this paper is well-received. I would like to accept it.
