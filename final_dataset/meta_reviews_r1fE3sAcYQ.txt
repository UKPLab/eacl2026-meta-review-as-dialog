 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Overcoming Multi-model Forgetting":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I am reviewing a paper titled "Overcoming Multi-model Forgetting". Can you provide me with a summary of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The first review states that the paper focuses on models performing same/identical tasks and delineates the parameters shared across models. However, the reviewer feels that the advances are incremental. The second review notes that the paper addresses catastrophic forgetting and proposes a solution, but the novelty compared to other works targeting the same issue is minimal. The third review praises the paper's handling of "neural brainwashing" and its potential for valuable contributions to the community of neural architecture search.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. What is the overall rating and confidence of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the overall rating is 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold, and the confidence is 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Can you provide more information on the first review, specifically the reviewer's concerns regarding the incremental nature of the advances?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The first reviewer states that the advances in the paper are incremental and does not understand central parts of the paper. The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation but acknowledges that the paper may have some novel aspects.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: What about the second review? Can you provide more information on the reviewer's concerns regarding the novelty of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The second reviewer notes that the paper's novelty compared to other works targeting the same issue is minimal. The reviewer suggests that comparing the paper to other state-of-the-art algorithms targeting catastrophic forgetting would enrich the experiments.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Can you provide more information on the third review, specifically the reviewer's praise for the paper's handling of "neural brainwashing"?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The third reviewer praises the paper's handling of "neural brainwashing" and notes that the derived new loss looks meaningful. The reviewer believes that the paper has the potential for valuable contributions to the community of neural architecture search.

Turn 6:

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews, what is your assessment of the paper's strengths and weaknesses?

Dialogue Agent: The paper's strengths include its handling of "neural brainwashing" and its potential for valuable contributions to the community of neural architecture search. However, the paper's weaknesses include the incremental nature of the advances and the minimal novelty compared to other works targeting the same issue. Additionally, the baseline numbers provided in the paper are too weak and do not provide convincing evidence of the paper's performance.
