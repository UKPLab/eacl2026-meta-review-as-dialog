Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Could you tell me about the main findings of the paper "Countering Language Drift via Grounding"?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, the paper investigates the problem of language drift in multi-agent communication. It proposes a solution by requiring that the messages between agents be usable as inputs to an image caption retrieval system, which prevents the divergence of language to a non-natural, code-like form. The experiments show that this approach is effective in countering language drift.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. I have a few questions about the reviews. First of all, Reviewer 1 mentioned that there is a weakness in the paper due to the need for more data for visual grounding. How would you address that?

Dialogue agent: I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation, but I can clarify that Reviewer 1 suggested adding another baseline that uses only text data (captions) without visual signals to compare the results fairly.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Reviewer 2 noted that the gains from adding grounding were not as strong as expected and wondered if a human evaluation might show more significant gains. How would you respond to that?

Dialogue agent: Again, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation, but I can point out that Reviewer 2 suggested evaluating the performance of PG+G without the +LM. Additionally, they mentioned a potential issue with the results in Figure 2, where the green line (PG+LM) may have continued climbing beyond 21 BLEU.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the helpful insights. Reviewer 3 mentioned several potential framing issues with the paper. How would you respond to those concerns?

Dialogue agent: I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation, but I can summarize that Reviewer 3 highlighted three potential goals of the paper that the authors may have intended: studying how to counter language drift in general, studying how to counter language drift in the MT task, or building a better/more data-efficient machine translation system. Reviewer 3 also suggested considering simpler solutions to prevent language drift and performing significance testing on the comparison between PG+LM+G and PG+LM performance for Fr->En->De.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the helpful summaries of the reviews. Finally, could you let me know the ratings and confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Of course. Reviewer 1 rated the paper 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold, and expressed a confidence level of 3, which means they are fairly confident that their evaluation is correct. Reviewer 2 also rated the paper 6 and expressed a confidence level of 4, which means they are confident but not absolutely certain that their evaluation is correct. Reviewer 3 also rated the paper 6 and expressed a confidence level of 4.
