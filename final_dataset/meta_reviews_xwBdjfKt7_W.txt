 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "SNN-RAT: Robustness-enhanced Spiking Neural Network through Regularized Adversarial Training":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "SNN-RAT: Robustness-enhanced Spiking Neural Network through Regularized Adversarial Training". Can you tell me what the paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new training method called Regularized Adversarial Training (RAT) for Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve their robustness against adversarial attacks.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, and the proposed SAT seems very effective over several strong adversaries.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, what about the weaknesses?

Dialogue Agent: The paper did not summarize previous efforts on improving the robustness of SNNs, and it did not provide comparisons with other related state-of-the-art algorithms, which makes it hard to recognize the contribution and value to this field. Additionally, some key references are missing in the paper, and the setting of the ablation study is unclear.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. How do you rate the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as a borderline accept with a confidence level of 5. The paper has technical solidity, but it lacks motivation and enough contribution compared to other related works.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on your summary, I think I have a good understanding of the paper's strengths and weaknesses. I will use your information to make my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any more information or clarification.
