Meta-reviewer: Thank you all for your reviews of this paper on Link Prediction in Hypergraphs using Graph Convolutional Networks. Based on your evaluations, it seems like the paper has some weaknesses, such as the marginal novelty of the proposed method and the weak experiments on small datasets. However, Reviewer 1 gave a marginally positive rating, Reviewer 2 rated the paper just below acceptance, and Reviewer 3 recommended rejection. I would like to hear more from the authors and the dialogue agent to help me make a final decision.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for considering this paper. Regarding the marginal novelty of the proposed method raised by Reviewers 1 and 3, I would like to point out that while the GCN-based approach for link prediction is not entirely new, our method also considers hypergraphs and dual transformation, which have not been fully explored in link prediction. As for the weak experiments on small datasets, we acknowledge that the datasets are small and we plan to perform experiments on larger datasets in future work.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for responding. Could you also address Reviewer 1's concern about the experimental results and the lack of measure of variance in tables 3 and 6? Can you explain the 10 trials mentioned in the figure captions and how the random feature matrix for the metabolic network is supposed to work?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. We apologize for not including a measure of variance in tables 3 and 6. We will update the paper with the variance measures. The 10 trials mentioned in the figure captions refer to a 10-fold cross-validation scheme used in the experiments. The random feature matrix for the metabolic network is generated by randomly selecting elements from the adjacency matrix. The "fake papers" mentioned in the paper for the citation networks are needed for negative sampling to create negative examples. As for how the set of candidate edges was chosen, we randomly sampled from the set of unobserved edges.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for clarifying those details. Reviewer 2 raised some concerns about the novelty of the proposed method and the weak experiments on small datasets. Can you respond to those concerns as well?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. Regarding the novelty of the proposed method, as I mentioned earlier, the combination of GCN with hypergraph and dual transformation has not been fully explored in link prediction. We believe that our proposed method has some unique contribution in this regard. As for the weak experiments on small datasets, we acknowledge that limitation and plan to perform experiments on larger datasets in future work. Additionally, we will consider comparing our method with other node embedding based methods, such as DeepWalk, LINE, and node2vec.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews and the responses, I am inclined to accept this paper with minor revisions. However, I would like the authors to address the concerns raised by the reviewers, include measures of variance in tables 3 and 6, and consider comparing the proposed method with other node embedding-based methods. Can you agree to these revisions?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, we acknowledge the concerns raised by the reviewers and agree to make the revisions suggested by the meta-reviewer. Thank you for considering our paper.
