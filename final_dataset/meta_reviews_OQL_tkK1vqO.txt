 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "ZARTS: On Zero-order Optimization for Neural Architecture Search":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "ZARTS: On Zero-order Optimization for Neural Architecture Search". Can you provide a summary of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new neural architecture search method called ZARTS, which uses zero-order optimization techniques to solve the bi-level optimization problem. It also provides an interesting analysis of the differentiable assumption in DARTS and shows that the assumption can distort the loss landscape, leading to severe instability issues.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper provides new and interesting analysis on the limitations of differentiable assumption in DARTS, and it shows that zero-order optimization can effectively alleviate the instability issue of DARTS. Additionally, the paper provides three variants of ZARTS by combining with three variants of DARTS, and experiments indicate that the variants can speed up the search process and further improve the performance.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Okay, what about the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: One potential weakness is that the authors base their zero-order search methods on three existing zero-order optimization algorithms, and the searching cost of ZARTS seems to be longer than other variants of DARTS. However, the authors provide a thorough evaluation of the paper, including extensive convergence experiments to show the stability of ZARTS.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews, I'm leaning towards accepting the paper, but I have some concerns about the searching cost of ZARTS. Can you provide any insights on this?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the searching cost of ZARTS is a potential concern. However, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the searching cost and show that it is comparable to other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the authors provide three variants of ZARTS, which can speed up the search process and further improve the performance. Overall, the paper provides a technically solid contribution to the field of neural architecture search.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and our conversation, I have decided to accept the paper with a rating of 7: Accept. The paper provides a technically solid contribution to the field of neural architecture search, and it has high impact on at least one sub-area.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your decision. I'm glad that I could assist you in evaluating the paper. If you have any further questions or need any additional information, please don't hesitate to ask.
