 Dialogue Agent: Hello! I understand you have a paper for me to review. Can you tell me a little bit about the paper and what kind of reviews you have received so far?

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, the paper is titled "Understanding the Effectiveness of Lipschitz-Continuity in Generative Adversarial Nets". The type of the paper is long, and the reviews I have received so far are [Review 1: The authors study the fundamental problems with GAN training. By performing a gradient analysis of the value surface of the optimal discriminator, the authors identify several key issues. In particular, for a fixed GAN objective they consider the optimal discriminator f* and analyze the gradients of f* at points x ~ P_g and x~P_d. The gradient decouples into the magnitude and direction terms. In previous work, the gradient vanishing issue was identified, and the authors show that it is fundamentally only controlling the magnitude. Furthermore, controlling the magnitude doesnt suffice as the gradient direction itself might be non-informative to move P_g to P_d. The authors proceed to analyze two cases: (1) No overlap between P_g and P_d, where they show that the original GAN formulation, as well as the Wasserstein GAN, will suffer from this issue, unless Lipschitz continuity is enforced. (2) For the case where P_g and P_d have overlap, the gradients will be locally useful, which the authors identify as the fundamental source of mode collapse. The main theoretical result suggests that (1) penalizing the discriminator proportionally to the square of the Lipschitz constant is the key -- the choice of divergence is not. This readily implies that pure Wasserstein divergence may fail to provide useful gradients, as well as that other divergences combined with Lipschitz penalties (precise technical details in the paper) might succeed. Furthermore, it also implies that one can mix and match the components of the objective function for the discriminator, as long as the penalty is present, giving rise to many objectives which are not necessarily proper divergences.], [Review 2: The authors try to claim that Lipschitz continuity of the discriminator is a fundamental solution of GANs, and that current methods do not satisfy this approach in principle. There are several false statements in this paper. In particular, sections 2.3 and 4.4 are wrong (and most of the paper is based on statements made there). The necessary constraint for the Wasserstein distance is NOT f(x) - f(y) <= d(x, y) for all x ~ Pr, y ~ Pg. It has to actually be 1-Lipschitz in the entire space. See Chapters 5 and 6 of [1], for example remark 6.4 or particular cases 5.16 and 5.4. Indeed, this is how it is written in all of the literature this reviewer is aware off, and it's a fact well used in the literature. Indeed, all the smoothness results for optimal transport in [1] heavily exploit the fact that the gradient of the critic is in the direction of the optimal transport map, which wouldn't be the case in the situation the authors try to claim of 'f not being defined outside of the support of Pr or Pg'. Furthermore, the relationship between Lipschitz continuity and having a gradient is elaborated in [2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875 , for example figure 2 clearly show this. Furthermore, and contrary to what section 4.5 tries to claim, the idea that most conclusions of wgan hold *without* the Wasserstein distance, but with Lipschitz continuity are already elaborated in the wgan paper. See in fact, appendix G.1 [3], where this is described in detail.], [Review 3: The paper proposes a general formulation of GAN-type adversarial learning as in (1), which includes the original GAN, WGAN, and IPM-type metrics as special cases. It also proposes use of the penalty term in terms of the Lipschitz constant of the discriminative function. Some of the arguments on the Wasserstein distance and on WGAN are not sound. The claim in Theorem 3 does not make sense, if we literally take its statement. All these points are detailed below. The main paper is clearly written, whereas in the appendices I noticed several grammatical and spelling errors as well as unclear descriptions. Despite that the arguments in this paper are interesting, the proposed scheme is somehow eventually similar to the gradient-penalty-based formulation in Gulrajani et al. (2017), with differences being introduction of loss metrics , , and the form of the gradient penalty,  max | f(x) |2^2 in this paper versus E[ ( | f(x) | - 1)^2 ] in Gulrajani et al. (2017). This fact has made me to think that the originality of this paper is marginal.].

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for the review. I see that you have provided multiple reviews for the paper. Can you tell me a little bit about each review and what you found to be the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Meta-Reviewer: Sure! Let me start with [Review 1]. The author studies the fundamental problems with GAN training and identifies several key issues. The author proceeds to analyze two cases: (1) No overlap between P_g and P_d, and (2) For the case where P_g and P_d have overlap. The author shows that the original GAN formulation, as well as the Wasserstein GAN, will suffer from this issue, unless Lipschitz continuity is enforced. The reviewer finds that the paper has a convincing discussion of why Wasserstein distance is not the key but rather it is the Lipschitz constant. The reviewer finds that the paper has a convincing discussion of why 1-Lipchitz is sufficient but might be too strong.
