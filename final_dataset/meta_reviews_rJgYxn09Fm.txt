 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I am reviewing a paper about learning implicitly recurrent CNNs through parameter sharing. What is your assessment of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper proposes a novel approach to weight sharing among CNN layers, which can reduce the number of trainable parameters and improve sample efficiency. The method is interesting and the results are convincing, but I suggest weighing the importance of reviewer confidence in the final decision.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: Can you summarize the reviewers' comments?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 recommends acceptance, highlighting the novelty and potential of the proposed approach. Reviewer 2 is not sure about the originality of the work and suggests more experiments to confirm the results. Reviewer 3 is marginally above the acceptance threshold and suggests more clarity on the connection between templates and layers.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: What are your thoughts on the novelty of the proposed approach?

Dialogue Agent: The related work section is sparse, but the proposed approach seems to be a novel application of template sharing in deep learning. However, the connection to existing work in this area is not fully explored.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: How do you assess the significance of the results?

Dialogue Agent: The results on CIFAR10 are promising, but the improvement in accuracy and parameter efficiency is not fully demonstrated on ImageNet. The trade-off between accuracy and parameter efficiency is well-studyed in the literature, but the proposed approach offers a new perspective.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Can you explain how the coefficient alpha is computed?

Dialogue Agent: The coefficient alpha is computed using cosine similarity between the templates, but the regularization terms for alpha are not discussed in the paper. The generic setup is not fully explored, and more experiments are needed to confirm the results.

Turn 6:

Meta-reviewer: What are your final thoughts on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper proposes an interesting approach to weight sharing among CNN layers, but more experiments and clarity on the connection to existing work are needed. The final decision should weigh the importance of reviewer confidence and the novelty of the proposed approach.
