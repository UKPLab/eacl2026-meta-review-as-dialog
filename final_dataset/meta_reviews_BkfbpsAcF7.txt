Meta-reviewer: Hello, thank you for joining me today to discuss the reviews for the paper "Excessive Invariance Causes Adversarial Vulnerability." Can you tell me about the overall consensus from the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. Overall, the reviews are mixed but generally positive. Reviewer 1 found the ideas in the paper quite interesting and novel, with strengths in studying the robustness of networks in non-iid settings. Reviewer 2 had some concerns about the scope and method of the paper, but acknowledged that the mathematical motivation is sound. Reviewer 3 appreciated the ideas developed in the paper, but struggled to find the main contribution due to a lack of detail on bijective networks.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. So, would you say that the paper is ready for publication?

Dialogue agent: As an AI language model, I am not programmed to provide opinions or recommendations about whether a paper should be published or not. However, I can provide more information from the reviewers to help you make an informed decision.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Reviewer 1 suggested that it would be convincing if the authors could show that their proposed new training objective increases robustness to distributional shift. Is this something that you think could be addressed by the authors?

Dialogue agent: Yes, this is a valid suggestion, and the authors may wish to consider it in their future work. Reviewer 2 also had some concerns about the proposed training objective and how it could achieve its goals. The authors may wish to address these concerns in a revised version of the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, and what about Reviewer 3's concern about the lack of detail on bijective networks?

Dialogue agent: The authors have added more details on bijective networks in the revised version of the paper, so this concern may have been addressed. However, the reviewer did not specifically comment on the revisions, so it is difficult to determine if they were sufficient.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Finally, can you tell me about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 both have moderate confidence in their evaluations, while Reviewer 2's confidence level is low.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for all of your help. Based on this information, I will carefully consider whether or not to accept the paper for publication.
