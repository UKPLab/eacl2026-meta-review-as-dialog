Decision Maker: Good evening everyone. I’m here tonight to learn more about aid to Africa and whether it’s doing more harm than good. I’m not sure which side to take, so I’m hoping the speakers on both sides can provide me with more information to help me form an opinion.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for being here tonight. It’s a complex issue, and there are arguments on both sides, but I’ll provide you with the relevant information to help you make an informed decision. Let’s start with the arguments for the motion that aid to Africa is doing more harm than good.

For Arguments:

David Rieff: “I think to the, you know, in the way that I want to invite you to vote for this, uh, resolution, it’s that on balance aid is, has done more harm, the resolution is well phrased, than good. It’s not that it’s a great, vast, you know, right-wing conspiracy or left-wing conspiracy, I suppose, in the instance. Um, it’s not that aid, some aid programs don’t work, and have not been shown to work. The problem, I think, and the reason that I, again, invite you to at least think hard about supporting this resolution, is that the whole discussion of aid avoids, makes a kind of moral and historical end run around the problem of politics. It becomes, if you like, a kind of technical question.”

David Rieff suggests that the aid narrative infantilizes those in need and deprives them of their agency. It also becomes a moral imperative that avoids the real problem of politics and listens to outsiders telling them how to behave. Aid does more harm than good by taking away people’s agency and setting up outsiders as the rule makers. We should support emergency relief as it directly helps those in need without having a larger political agenda.

Against Arguments:

Gayle Smith: “The emerging debate now among policy-makers, among NGO’s, among Africans, is that foreign aid in the case of the United States needs to be elevated, number one, so that it is on par with some of our other foreign-policy institutions. But more importantly, protected from the politics that would drive it in the wrong direction. That, in other words, we need to learn how and move towards ring-fencing development assistance, so that it can’t be used… for reasons other than development.”

Gayle Smith argues that we cannot reject aid altogether because it is an important tool for development. She notes that we need to elevate aid’s status so it’s not seen as a tool for politics and protected so that it goes towards development. And she points out that aid has had clear successes like the eradication of smallpox and increased primary enrollment rates.

Decision Maker: It seems like both sides have valid points. On one hand, aid can be ineffective and set up outsiders as rule makers without empowering the local population. But on the other hand, it’s important to elevate aid’s status and protect it from becoming politicized.

Dialogue Agent: That’s true, and it’s important to note that aid is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different forms of aid can have different outcomes. For example, emergency relief can be very effective in immediate situations, but long-term development aid needs to be smarter in how it’s delivered. Aid also needs to be paired with trade policies that benefit Africa so that they can be self-sufficient.

For Arguments:

William Easterly: “I say to you that aid, uh, and this is borne out by statistical evidence, that aid worsens corruption, aid blocks democracy, aid is an obstacle to the freeing of Africans from predatory rulers…”

William Easterly argues that aid can worsen corruption and block democracy. He also notes that it’s important to focus on the practical things that can be done to reduce poverty.

Against Arguments:

Gayle Smith: “The last point I would make is that I think the reason this motion is flawed is because at the end of the day development matters. And at the end of the day, the United States as a government, citizens of the United States, private companies in the United States, philanthropists in the United States, as around the rest of the world, I believe, have a responsibility and an interest in promoting development.”

Gayle Smith counters that development is important and that we all have a responsibility in promoting it.

Decision Maker: So, it seems like there’s no one clear answer to whether aid is doing more harm than good. It’s a complex issue that depends on how aid is delivered and its intended outcomes. Ultimately, we need to elevate aid’s status and protect it from becoming politicized to ensure that it’s delivering on its intended mission of promoting development.

Dialogue Agent: That’s a good conclusion. It’s important to look at both sides of the argument and gather information before making a decision. Thank you for joining us tonight.
