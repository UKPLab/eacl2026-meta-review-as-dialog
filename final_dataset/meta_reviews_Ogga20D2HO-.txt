Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Can you provide a summary of the reviews for the paper "FedMix: Approximation of Mixup under Mean Augmented Federated Learning"?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. The paper proposed a novel approach called MAFL to address non-iid data in Federated Learning by using the mean of the local client data. The proposed method, FedMix, approximates the global Mixup formulation using Taylor's expansion. Review 1 had several questions, including why not use Global Mixup directly, issues with poorly written math, and concerns about experimental results. Reviewer 2 had concerns about communication and computation efficiency, privacy, and the need for more experiments. Finally, Reviewer 3 raised concerns about privacy and computational burden while proposing additional experiments to provide more insight into the work.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. After considering the reviews and the paper itself, what is your recommendation for accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the paper itself, the recommendation is to marginally accept the paper with a rating of 6. While there are some concerns raised by the reviewers, the overall research direction is promising, and the proposed approach is well-motivated and effective in improving test accuracies. The authors have addressed some of the concerns raised by the reviewers, while the remaining concerns can be addressed through further experiments or discussions. However, the confidence level for this recommendation is 4, as there are still some unresolved issues that may affect the final decision.
