 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Regression from Upper One-side Labeled Data":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Regression from Upper One-side Labeled Data". Can you provide me with a summary of the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper considers a regression setting where only upper-side labeled data (i.e., data with labels only for the positive class) is available. The authors propose a novel learning algorithm that is unbiased and consistent, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. The main contributions of the paper are the introduction of a new weakly supervised regression problem and the proposal of a consistent learning algorithm to solve it.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the reviewers' opinions on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews provided, Reviewer 1 expresses some concerns about the gap between the proposed algorithm and the actual implementation, and feels that the presentation of the paper could be improved. Reviewer 2 mentions that the authors do not fully justify the problem setting and the technical contribution of the algorithm is limited. Reviewer 3 is also concerned about the practical operation used in the experiments and feels that the problem setting is not well justified.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on your understanding, what are the main concerns of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: The main concerns of the reviewers are the gap between the proposed algorithm and the actual implementation, the presentation of the paper, and the problem setting not being well justified.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: I see. How do you think the authors should address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the authors could improve the presentation of the paper, provide more justification for the problem setting, and address the gap between the proposed algorithm and the actual implementation. Additionally, the authors could consider using a ground-truth regression line to separate the given data, as suggested by Reviewer 3.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on the reviews and your summary, I will make my final decision on the paper.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if there's anything else I can help with.
