 Sure, here is a dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper, with the meta-reviewer relying on the dialogue agent for a final decision. The paper's title is "KnockoffGAN: Generating Knockoffs for Feature Selection using Generative Adversarial Networks." The meta-reviewer is aware only of the paper's title. The dialogue agent is equipped with reviews and paper type information. The output should feature only the dialogue, without duplicated sentences, and the dialogue agent should present answers in a summarized form without bullet points.

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I am a meta-reviewer for a paper titled "KnockoffGAN: Generating Knockoffs for Feature Selection using Generative Adversarial Networks." Can you help me assess this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I have access to reviews and paper type information. Based on the reviews, the paper seems to be well-written and addresses an important problem. The use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate knockoffs for feature selection is a novel approach.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds promising. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper's strengths include its novelty, the use of GANs to generate knockoffs, and the ability to control the FDR. However, the paper has some limitations in the empirical evaluation, particularly in the real-data experiment. The evaluation is not very informative due to the lack of transparency in the dataset and the use of a different feature selection criterion and FDR cutoff than the simulations.

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. What about the technical details of the proof in the appendix?

Dialogue Agent: I did not review the technical details of the proof in the appendix. However, based on the reviews, the paper's technical aspects seem to be well-presented and appropriate for the paper's contributions.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews and your summarized answers, I will make a final decision on the paper.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! If you have any further questions or need additional information, feel free to ask.
