 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper, with the title "Generalized Tensor Models for Recurrent Neural Networks":

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Generalized Tensor Models for Recurrent Neural Networks". Can you tell me a little bit about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper explores the use of generalized tensor models for recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The authors extend the work of TT-RRN [Khrulkov et al., 2018] to further analyze the connection between RNN and tensor train (TT) decomposition by incorporating generalized nonlinearity, i.e., ReLU, into the network architectures.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the expressivity power of TTD-based RNN, both theoretical result and empirical validation show that generalized TTD-based RNN is more superior to CP-based shallow network in terms of depth efficiency. The paper also introduces a new toy example to illustrate the application of the proposed method.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are some of the limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The contribution and novelty of this paper is incremental and somewhat limited, since the analysis of TT-RNN based on the product nonlinearity already exists. The analysis is mainly focused on the particular case of rectifier nonlinearity, and the authors do not discuss the general nonlinearities. Additionally, the paper does not provide a concrete toy example to illustrate the application of the proposed method.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are your recommendations for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would recommend that the authors provide a more detailed introduction to the concept of score functions and feature tensors, and clarify the usage of the term "logits" in the paper. Additionally, the authors should provide more details about the application of the proposed method, such as the choice of M and the usage of overlapped or non-overlapped patches. Finally, the authors should provide a more comprehensive analysis of the general nonlinearities.

Turn 5:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on the reviews and your recommendations, I will make my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
