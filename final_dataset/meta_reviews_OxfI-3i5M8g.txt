 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Scalable Neural Video Representations with Learnable Positional Features":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Scalable Neural Video Representations with Learnable Positional Features". Can you tell me what the paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new framework for neural video representations that incorporates learnable positional features to improve the efficiency and quality of video encoding.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper introduces a new coordinate-based architecture for video representation, which learns keyframes automatically from the videos. The proposed method also includes a compute- and memory-efficient compression procedure to further reduce the parameters and training cost.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: How does the paper compare to existing work in the field?

Dialogue Agent: The paper builds upon existing CNR frameworks, but with a new approach to learnable positional features. The proposed method has been shown to improve upon existing PSNR metrics and parameter-efficiency. However, the paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods in learning-based video compression.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: What are some of the limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has some limitations, such as the lack of a comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods and the potential for the keyframe idea to not work well for long videos composed of multiple dynamic scenes. Additionally, the experimental part is not sufficient, and some experimental settings are unfair to some extent.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews, how would you rate the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as a weak accept. The paper has a moderate-to-high impact, with no major concerns regarding evaluation, resources, reproducibility, or ethical considerations. However, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods and a more detailed discussion of the possible limitations of the model design.

Turn 6:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help. I will consider your responses when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can assist you with.
