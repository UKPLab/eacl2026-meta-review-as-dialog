Meta-reviewer: Hi there, I have read the reviews for the paper "Zeroth-Order Hard-Thresholding: Gradient Error vs. Expansivity". Can you provide me with more information about the paper and its reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, the paper proposes a novel stochastic zeroth-order hard-thresholding algorithm for $\ell_0$ constrained stochastic optimization, making use of random support sampling. The authors provide convergence guarantees of SZOHT under standard assumptions, and the query complexity of SZOHT has weak or no dependence under different settings. The paper also discusses the trade-off between the error of the zeroth-order estimate and the expansivity of the hard-thresholding operator, resulting in a minimal value for the number of random directions q. The paper includes extensive experiments on synthetic and real-life datasets and shows improvements over previous work.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main weaknesses and strengths of the paper, based on the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 identified the main concern as the discussion around the choice of $q$. The reviewer found the construction of $q$ unclear and unusual and suggested some minor modifications to the paper. Review 2 mentioned that the author's contribution is novel, and the experiments are extensive, ran on real-life datasets like adversarial attacks, which shows that the method works well on large-scale practical machine learning problems. The paper and its results are well-organized and presented clearly. The main weakness is that the paper is not written clearly enough in some parts and has some typographical errors, which can be easily addressed. Review 3 asked some questions concerning the sparsity of $k$, the role of $\mu$ in the convergence analysis, and the estimation of parameters, among others, but overall found the ideas and the algorithm easy to follow.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the brief summary. Based on the reviews, do you have any recommendation regarding the paper's fate?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1's main concern appears to be related to clarity and not a fundamental flaw with the paper. Review 2 highlights that the paper's contribution is novel and the experiments are extensive and well-organized, while mentioning some minor weaknesses. Review 3 asks questions about the paper's assumptions and parameters but overall finds the paper easy to follow. Therefore, I recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions.
