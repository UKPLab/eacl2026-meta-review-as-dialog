Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Thank you for your assistance. I have read the reviews for the paper titled "The Comparative Power of ReLU Networks and Polynomial Kernels in the Presence of Sparse Latent Structure," and I have a few questions.

Dialogue agent: Of course, what would you like to know?

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews, it seems like the paper has made a significant contribution to the field. However, Reviewer 3 seems to suggest that the paper is not clear on the relationship between the problem being studied and typical applications. Can you explain this further?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 3 mentions that while the paper is motivated from practical applications, the problem being studied is a simple and particular question. The reviewers suggest that the relationship between the two could be clearer. However, as a dialogue agent, I cannot offer any opinions or recommendations on the matter.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Moving on to Reviewer 1, they seem to recommend the acceptance of the paper. Can you provide any insights into their reasoning?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 provides a clear summary of the main contributions of the paper and states that it is well-written and provides new insights into the representation power of neural nets. They also point out that it is interesting to know that ReLU networks can be approximated by low degree polynomials in the non-worst case scenario. Based on their evaluation, Reviewer 1 recommends the acceptance of the paper.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What about Reviewer 2? They also seem to recommend acceptance of the paper.

Dialogue agent: Yes, Reviewer 2 provides a detailed evaluation of the paper, highlighting its strong results and intriguing observation of moving away from uniform approximators. They do suggest adding prior work at the intersection of kernel methods and neural networks and providing clearer definitions and proof sketches. However, based on their evaluation, Reviewer 2 also recommends accepting the paper.

Meta-reviewer: I appreciate your help, Dialogue Agent. Based on the reviews, it seems like the paper has made significant contributions and is well-written. I will consider the confidence levels and make a decision.
