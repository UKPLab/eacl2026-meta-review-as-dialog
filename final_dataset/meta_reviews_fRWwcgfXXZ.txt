Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews of the paper "Deep Learning Methods for Proximal Inference via Maximum Moment Restriction", and I have a few questions before making a decision regarding its acceptance.

Dialogue Agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I'm here to answer any questions you might have about the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Can you summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the paper as mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Review 1 mentions that the paper proposes a new deep learning method for proximal inference, with desirable numerical performance and a consistency result as a theoretical justification. However, the review suggests that the authors could potentially strengthen their theoretical results and provide more practical guidance on how to choose their proposed methods. Review 2 notes that the paper provides convincing simulations that demonstrate that a U statistic loss for neural networks outperforms previous work. However, the review also expresses some substantial concerns about the main result, particularly regarding Theorem 1. Review 3 mentions that the paper proposes a novel extension of PMMR to NMMR, with strong theoretical results and superior performance over existing methods. However, the review also notes some limitations in the presentation and the assumption of a restrictive discriminator function.

Meta-reviewer: Given these strengths and weaknesses, what are your thoughts on the paper's acceptance?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations regarding the acceptance of the paper. However, I can provide information regarding the reviews and the rating assigned by each reviewer. Review 1 gave a rating of 8, which indicates a strong acceptance. Review 2 gave a rating of 6, which indicates a weak acceptance. Review 3 also gave a rating of 6, which also indicates a weak acceptance. It's worth noting that Review 2 and Review 3 mention some concerns and limitations regarding the paper, particularly in the presentation and the theoretical results. However, Review 1 mentions that the paper is technically strong, with novel ideas and no unaddressed ethical considerations.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information, dialogue agent. One thing I'm considering is the confidence level of each reviewer. Can you provide that as well?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, I can. Review 1 expressed a confidence level of 4, indicating a high level of confidence in their assessment, but with the possibility of not understanding some parts of the submission or being unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Review 2 expressed a confidence level of 4 as well, indicating a similar level of confidence in their assessment. Review 3 expressed a confidence level of 5, indicating absolute certainty about their assessment and being very familiar with the related work.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information, dialogue agent. I will consider the strengths, weaknesses, ratings, and confidence levels of the reviews carefully before making a decision.
