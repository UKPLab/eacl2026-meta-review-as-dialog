Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I've reviewed the reviews for the paper "Simple and Effective VAE Training with Calibrated Decoders". Reviewer 1 had some concerns about the paper's focus on Gaussian decoders for modeling images, as well as the clarity of the connection between a VAE with a Gaussian decoder and a beta-VAE framework. However, after the authors' rebuttal, Reviewer 1 increased their rating to a 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold. Reviewer 2 had concerns about the novelty and soundness of the experiments, particularly regarding the baselines. They also had minor comments on the paper's terminology and title. Reviewer 2 rated the paper a 5, which is marginally below the acceptance threshold. Finally, Reviewer 3 found the proposed approach to be too simple to validate its novelty, but they acknowledged the paper's well-written content and sufficient evidence. They also had some concerns about the images generated in Figure 8 but found the mutual information analysis to be helpful. Reviewer 3 rated the paper a 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold. Overall, there are some concerns about the paper's novelty and soundness of experiments that need to be addressed. Do you have any questions or comments? 

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for providing me with this feedback. I understand that the reviewers had some concerns regarding the novelty of our approach and the soundness of the experiments, particularly with regards to the performance of the baselines and the images generated in Figure 8. We will carefully consider these concerns and make appropriate revisions to the paper to address them. Is there anything else we should be aware of? 

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, it is important to note that Reviewer 1 highlighted the need for appropriate distributions to model observed data and stressed the importance of treating VAEs as a probabilistic model. The authors should make this clear in the paper and provide an explanation of why Gaussian decoders are not always appropriate for modeling images. Additionally, Reviewer 2 had some minor comments on the paper's terminology and title, which should also be addressed. 

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for bringing these concerns to our attention. We will make sure to address all of these points in our revisions to the paper. We appreciate the reviewers' feedback and will work to improve the quality of our submission.
