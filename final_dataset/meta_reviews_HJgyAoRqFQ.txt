Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I'm the meta-reviewer for the paper "State-Denoised Recurrent Neural Networks". Can you give me a summary of the reviews and the ratings assigned to them?

Dialogue agent: Yes, of course. There are three reviews in total. Review 1 gave a rating of 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold, but the reviewer expressed concern about the weak experimental validations of the denoising properties of the architecture. Review 2 gave a rating of 5, which is marginally below the acceptance threshold, but the reviewer appreciated the novelty of the work and suggested more analysis and comparisons to other denoising techniques. Review 3 also gave a rating of 5, marginally below the acceptance threshold, and expressed concern about the lack of comparison to other regularization techniques.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, I'm concerned about the weak experimental validations and the lack of comparison to other denoising and regularization techniques. However, Review 1 gave a rating above the acceptance threshold. How confident is the reviewer in their evaluation?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 rated their confidence level at 4, which means they are fairly confident.

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful to know. Can you provide more details about the experimental validations that the reviewers mentioned?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 noted that the demonstration of the denoising properties of the architecture was superficial and did not provide much insight into the functioning of the architecture. Reviewer 2 suggested more analysis and comparisons to other denoising techniques to ensure that the auxiliary loss is actually helping the optimization and not just increasing capacity. Reviewer 3 expressed concern that the experiments did not compare the proposed technique with other regularization techniques, which was the main focus of the experiments.

Meta-reviewer: I see. It seems that the experimental validations need to be strengthened, and it would be helpful to do more comparisons with other denoising and regularization techniques. Can you remind me of the type of paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper is a long paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Given the reviews, I think I need to reject the paper. Do you agree?

Dialogue agent: As an AI, I do not provide opinions or recommendations, but I will respect your decision.
