Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you tell me a bit about the paper titled "Alternating Mirror Descent for Constrained Min-Max Games?"

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper proposes a method for solving bilinear 2-player zero-sum games in the constrained setting using alternating mirror descent. The method is analyzed and shown to converge to a Nash equilibrium at a rate of K^{-2/3} after K iterations. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. And what is the type of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper is categorized as long.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Now, let's move on to the reviews. Reviewer 1 noted some weaknesses regarding the analysis assumptions. Could you elaborate on that?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 pointed out that the assumptions on the boundedness of Bregman divergence(s) clash with the assumptions of phi and psi being Legendre. The author's result does not seem to apply to the case where the domain P and Q are the probability simplex and the divergence is KL, as KL is unbounded. The reviewer suggested that a more thorough discussion of the limitations implied by the assumptions in Theorem 3.2 would have been appreciated.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. And what about Reviewer 2? Did they have any major concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2 had no major concerns, rating the paper as weak accept and technically solid. However, they did mention some related work that the authors could consider in future revisions.

Meta-Reviewer: Finally, Reviewer 3 pointed out some weaknesses related to the paper's setting and assumptions. What can you tell me about that?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3 noted that while the proposed method is interesting, it requires coordination between both players, which is not completely clear why backward discretization is actually a problem given that it gets O(K^{-1}) regret. They also noted that some of the assumptions could be tackled more directly.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the thorough overview. Based on these reviews, I'm still not entirely sure what to do. There seem to be some weaknesses, but overall the paper is technically solid and valuable. Can you provide any insights that might help me make a decision?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, it is not my place to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can provide further clarifications if you have any specific questions about the paper or its reviews.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. I think I'll need to consider the reviews more carefully before making a decision. Thank you for your help. 

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome. Let me know if you have any further questions.
