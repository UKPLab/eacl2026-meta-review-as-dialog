Meta-Reviewer: Hello dialogue agent. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper titled "Latent Domain Transfer: Crossing modalities with Bridging Autoencoders", and I am hoping to make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Hello Meta-Reviewer. I am aware of the reviews and can answer any questions you may have to assist in your decision-making process.

Meta-Reviewer: Great. The first review acknowledges that the proposed method can transfer positive knowledge but suggests that the manuscript needs to discuss the transfer of negative transferring. What are your thoughts on this issue?

Dialogue Agent: I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations regarding the reviews or the paper. However, I can tell you that the first review proposes that the authors should discuss negative transferring to avoid the transfer of negative knowledge information. 

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. The second review suggests that the paper lacks technical novelty, and a section of conclusions is missing. What can you tell me about this issue?

Dialogue Agent: Like I said earlier, I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations regarding the reviews or the paper. But I can tell you that the second review points out that the authors should put the proposed solution in the context of transfer learning, which may better show the significance of this work. Additionally, the review says that there are many grammar errors throughout the paper, and a conclusion section is missing.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay. The third review points out that the paper's structure needs improvement, and the experiments are not convincing. Do you have any thoughts on this issue?

Dialogue Agent: Again, I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations regarding the reviews or the paper. Nevertheless, the third review states that the paper's structure needs improvement. In particular, the related work is put at the end of the paper, and the tables and figures are hard to follow sometimes. Also, the review says that some implementation details are unclear, such as the number of labeled samples used in Table 2. Furthermore, the technical implementation of the proposition is somewhat trivial, and the authors need to compare with more state-of-the-art methods like StarGAN.

Meta-Reviewer: Alright. I have gone through all the reviews, and it seems like the paper needs some improvements. However, I am trying to make a decision based on how certain the reviewers are concerning their ratings. Can you tell me about this issue?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the reviewers' confidence ratings are all rated at four out of five, which signifies that they are confident but not entirely certain that their evaluation of the paper is correct. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on this information, I have decided to reject the paper.
