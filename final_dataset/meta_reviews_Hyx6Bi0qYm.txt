Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for being here to discuss the reviews for the paper "Adversarial Domain Adaptation for Stable Brain-Machine Interfaces." Can you give me a brief summary of the paper and its contributions?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, meta-reviewer. The paper proposes a novel approach using adversarial domain adaptation to address the nonstationarity/stability problem in implanted brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). The authors use a latent representation extracted from intracortical local field potential (iLFP) signals and an autoencoder (AE) to reconstruct the neural activity. A long short-term memory (LSTM) network is then trained to predict muscle activity from the iLFP-based latent representation. To address the drift in the neural signals, the authors compare the performances of three domain adaptation algorithms: canonical correlation analysis (CCA), Kullback-Leibler divergence minimization (KLDM), and adversarial domain adaptation network (ADAN). The results show that the ADAN approach outperforms the other two algorithms.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the paper. Reviewer 1 gave the paper a strong accept rating, but also pointed out some areas for improvement. What is your response to their comments?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 provided valuable feedback on the paper. In particular, the authors could provide more detailed explanations of some parts of their approach, such as the simultaneous training of the AE and the LSTM network. The authors could also perform experiments on a different dataset to further validate their claims of unsupervised neural recording alignment using their approach. As for the unclear results of Figure 2B, the authors could clarify this in a revised version of the paper. However, the positive evaluation of the paper's contributions by Reviewer 1 still stands.

Meta-reviewer: That's good to hear. However, Reviewer 2 gave the paper a rating marginally below acceptance threshold. What are your thoughts on their review?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 made several important points about the paper's lack of clarity, adequate rigor, and focus. They suggest that the paper would benefit from concrete comparisons and controls for the autoencoder and domain adaptation algorithms. They also suggest that the paper's contributions could be more convincingly demonstrated with online testing in two animals. Furthermore, Reviewer 2 questioned the meaningfulness of the 6% improvement in the BMI's performance claimed by the authors. While the concerns raised by Reviewer 2 are valid, the reviewer's confidence in their evaluation is moderate.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Lastly, Reviewer 3 gave the paper a good rating and accepted it, but also suggested that the authors tone down their claims, reference prior work, and consider releasing the data upon acceptance. What is your response to their feedback?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 3 provides valuable feedback on the paper's claims and their relation to prior work. The reviewer suggests that the authors should avoid making definitive statements about being the first to solve the nonstationarity problem in BMIs and reference prior literature that addresses this issue. The suggestion to release the data upon acceptance would also be beneficial for the scientific community. However, the reviewer is highly confident in their evaluation of the paper's contributions. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent, for your responses to the reviews. Based on our discussion and the reviewers' evaluations, I am inclined to accept the paper, although I recommend that the authors address the concerns raised by Reviewer 2 and further clarify their approach where necessary.
