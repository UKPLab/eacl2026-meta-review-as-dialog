 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:
Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper called "DOM-Q-NET: Grounded RL on Structured Language". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The authors propose a novel architecture for RL-based web navigation, called DOM-Q-NET, which utilizes a graph neural network to represent tree-structured HTML along with a shared state space across multiple tasks. The key contribution is the use of multi-task learning to improve performance.

Turn 2:
Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main evaluation metrics used in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors use a moving average of the reward for the last 100 episodes, and report the highest success rate for testing on 100 episodes. However, the reviewer has noted that this may be misleading due to the potential for lucky seeds.

Turn 3:
Meta-reviewer: I see. What are the potential sources of novelty in this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The use of graph neural networks and multi-task learning are novel aspects of this paper, and the application of RL to web navigation is a relatively under-explored area.

Turn 4:
Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me more about the evaluation methodology used in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors use a variety of evaluation metrics, including the moving average of the reward, the highest success rate, and the average success rate with confidence intervals. However, the reviewer has noted that the use of the highest success rate may be misleading.

Turn 5:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I am leaning towards accepting the paper, but I have some concerns about the evaluation methodology. What are your thoughts on this?

Dialogue Agent: I understand the reviewer's concerns. The use of the highest success rate may be misleading, and the authors may want to consider using alternative evaluation metrics or methods to address this issue. Additionally, the authors may want to provide more context about the novelty of their approach and how it differs from previous work in the area.
