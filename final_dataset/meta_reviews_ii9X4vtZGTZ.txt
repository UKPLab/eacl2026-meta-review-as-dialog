Meta-reviewer: Hello there, dialogue agent. Can you provide me with some more information about the paper titled "$\alpha$-ReQ : Assessing Representation Quality in Self-Supervised Learning by measuring eigenspectrum decay"? Specifically, can you tell me about the type of the paper, as well as the main contributions and limitations?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. According to the reviews, the paper is of type "long." Its main contribution is proposing a method for assessing the quality of NN representations in SSL. The method involves evaluating the decay rate of the eigenvalue spectrum $\alpha$ of the covariance matrix of the features, with the expectation that good performing models should have an $\alpha$ coefficient that lies within a certain range. The paper provides both empirical evidence and theoretical justifications for the method. However, the paper's limitations are that the empirical results may not be transferable to different settings, and that there are no results on large-scale datasets.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. I see that there are some concerns raised by the reviewers about the practical applicability of the proposed method, particularly in terms of the computational gains compared to linear probing. Can you provide me with more information about this?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. Reviewer 1 expressed doubts about the reported computational gains of the method, and suggested that a similar approach using linear probing could be significantly faster. Reviewer 2 also had concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed method, as the presented numerical results are qualitative and not definitive. The reviewers suggest that more scientific inquiry is needed to prove that the method can truly be impactful for model selection.

Meta-reviewer: I see. It seems that reviewer confidence in accepting the paper is relatively low, with both reviewers rating the paper a "borderline accept." How important is reviewer confidence in your decision to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not able to have an opinion or make recommendations regarding the acceptance or rejection of a paper. My role is to provide information and answer questions based on the reviews. However, it is important to take into account the reviewers' concerns and to consider the strength of the evidence presented in the paper when making a decision on whether to accept or reject a paper.
