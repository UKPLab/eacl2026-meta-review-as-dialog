 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper, based on the provided reviews:

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper called "Structured Neural Summarization". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a structured neural summarization model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with a sequential approach to abstractive summarization. The model is applied to both natural and programming language datasets, and the authors claim that it outperforms existing methods.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the reviewer's opinions on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, reviewer 1 has some questions about the novelty of the proposed model and the usefulness of the proposed method for natural language summarization. Reviewer 2 has some suggestions for further evaluation and ablation studies to better understand the contributions of the model. Reviewer 3 has a positive view of the paper and suggests some minor improvements for the writing.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. Reviewer 1 is marginally above acceptance threshold and has some questions about the novelty of the proposed model and the usefulness of the proposed method for natural language summarization. Reviewer 2 is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and has some suggestions for further evaluation and ablation studies. Reviewer 3 has a positive view of the paper and suggests some minor improvements for the writing.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews, do you think the paper is acceptable or not?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper is marginally above acceptance threshold. However, the reviewers have some questions and suggestions for further evaluation and ablation studies to better understand the contributions of the model.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. I think I have a good understanding of the paper now.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.
