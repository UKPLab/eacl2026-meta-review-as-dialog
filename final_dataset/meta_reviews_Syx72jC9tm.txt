 Sure, here is a dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper, with the meta-reviewer relying on the dialogue agent to make a final decision:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I am a meta-reviewer for a paper titled "Invariant and Equivariant Graph Networks". I have read the reviews and would like to discuss the paper with you. Can you please summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Review 1 states that the paper presents a maximally expressive parameter-sharing scheme for hypergraphs and generalizes to multiple sets. However, the reviewer raises concerns about the experimental results and the lack of certain benchmark datasets. Review 2 praises the paper's contribution to the field of equivariant graph neural networks, but notes that the authors' model does not actually map to what is used in practice. Review 3 commends the paper for exploring maximally expressive linear layers for jointly exchangeable data and providing a surprisingly expressive model. However, the reviewer also notes that the paper does not discuss the case of symmetric input tensors and that the experimental results may be misleading.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on these reviews, I am considering rejecting the paper due to the concerns raised in Review 1 and the lack of benchmark datasets. However, I am also aware that the paper presents a novel and interesting contribution to the field. What are your thoughts on the paper's merits and drawbacks?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper presents a well-motivated and interesting contribution to the field of equivariant graph neural networks. However, the experimental results may be misleading due to the lack of certain benchmark datasets and the fact that the authors' model does not actually map to what is used in practice. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the case of symmetric input tensors, which may be a significant oversight. Overall, I would rate the paper as having a moderate to high level of novelty and relevance, but with some concerns about the experimental results and the lack of benchmark datasets.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on your summary and your thoughts on the paper's merits and drawbacks, I have decided to reject the paper. However, I appreciate your help in evaluating the paper and your input has been valuable in my decision-making process.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any other papers you would like me to assist with, please don't hesitate to ask.
