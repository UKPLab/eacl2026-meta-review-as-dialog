Meta-reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, I have been assigned as the meta-reviewer for the paper "G-SGD: Optimizing ReLU Neural Networks in its Positively Scale-Invariant Space." Can you please provide me with a summary of the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Sure. There are three reviews for this paper. Review 1 gave a rating of 7 and found the paper to be good and novel, but raised concerns about low readability and suggested combining it with other optimization algorithms. Review 2 also gave a rating of 7 and appreciated the well-organized paper. They had some questions about the computational overhead and the necessity of free skeleton weights but generally found the paper promising. Review 3 also gave a rating of 7 and raised doubts about the empirical significance of the proposed method.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, what is your recommendation regarding the acceptance of the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide any recommendations. However, I can provide you with the ratings and confidence levels of the reviewers.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Can you provide me with more information about the concerns raised in each review?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 raised concerns about the low readability of the paper and suggested combining it with other optimization algorithms. Review 2 asked for clarification about the computational overhead and the necessity of free skeleton weights. They also suggested including Path-SGD results in Table 1. Review 3 doubted the empirical significance of the proposed method, despite appreciating the well-organized paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on these reviews, how confident are the reviewers about their evaluation of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 had a confidence level of 2, indicating that the reviewer understood the paper but may not have grasped central parts of it. Review 2 had a confidence level of 3, meaning that the reviewer was fairly confident. Review 3 had a confidence level of 4, indicating that the reviewer was confident but not absolutely certain.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. It seems that the reviewers have some concerns and doubts about the proposed method, but overall they find the paper to be well-organized and novel. I will consider these factors while making my decision.
