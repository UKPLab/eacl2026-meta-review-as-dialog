Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the paper "Finite-Time Analysis of Fully Decentralized Single-Timescale Actor Critic," and I have some questions based on the reviews provided.

Dialogue Agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I'll do my best to answer your questions based on the reviews.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 1 mentioned that the paper does not explain why its results are better than those of another paper with a similar algorithm. Can you please explain why this paper's results are better?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but I can tell you that the strength of this paper lies in its convergence bound, which attains the lower bound up to logarithmic factors. This is a significant result that adds to the existing literature on fully decentralized single-timescale actor-critic algorithms.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Reviewer 2 mentioned that the algorithm in this paper requires global observability of actions, which may not be possible in practice. Can you explain why this is necessary, and whether it can be alleviated?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the algorithm's global observability requirement is due to the fact that all agents need to observe the global state to make updates to their value and policy functions. However, this can be mitigated by using communication protocols that allow agents to share information in a decentralized manner.

Meta-reviewer: That's good to know. Finally, Reviewer 3 mentioned that the paper only shows convergence to a saddle point, not an optimal point. Can you addresses this issue?

Dialogue Agent: Again, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. But I can tell you that the paper's contribution is in showing convergence of the algorithm in a fully decentralized multi-agent setting, while minimizing the number of additional tuning parameters. The optimization criteria can be further determined by the specific mission requirements, and it is possible that converging to a saddle point is sufficient depending on the context of the application.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your answers, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, it seems like this paper has some strengths and weaknesses, but overall is technically solid. I think I am leaning towards a borderline accept rating, but I still need to weigh the reviewer confidence levels. 

Dialogue Agent: Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with in making a final decision.
