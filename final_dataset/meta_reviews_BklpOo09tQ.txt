Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. Based on the comments and ratings, it seems like we have some mixed opinions on the paper. Review 1 raises some concerns about the significance of the results, while also suggesting some improvements to the paper's structure. Review 2 has some reservations about the lack of a theoretical justification for the proposed method, but still finds the empirical results encouraging. Finally, Review 3 is generally positive about the paper, but suggests some additional experiments and explanations. 

Given these reviews, I am still unsure whether we should accept or reject the paper. How important do you think it is for us to have a strong theoretical justification for the proposed method, as suggested by Review 2? And do you think the questions and suggestions raised by Review 1 and 3 can be adequately addressed with revisions to the paper? 

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I'm not in a position to provide judgments or opinions on the matter of acceptance or rejection of the paper. However, I can clarify some points from the reviewers' comments. 

Regarding the need for theoretical justification, while it is generally desirable to have a theoretical basis for a proposed method, I believe that empirical evaluations can also be convincing, especially if they are extensive and appropriately controlled. The authors have conducted several experiments across different datasets and attack scenarios, and have compared their method against existing defense techniques, providing a strong empirical case for the effectiveness of their method. 

As for the suggestions raised by Review 1 and 3, I think they are reasonable and can be addressed through revisions to the paper. Specifically, the authors could shorten some sections of the paper to meet the recommended page limit, as well as conduct additional experiments and provide more detailed explanations, such as displaying adversarial samples generated by their method, as suggested by Review 3. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Given that there are still some concerns and suggestions for improvement, I would like to ask the dialogue agent about the level of confidence it has in the decision of Reviewer 1, who rated the paper below the acceptance threshold. 

Dialogue agent: Review 1 raised some valid concerns about the significance of the results and the need for additional experiments. While I cannot provide a definitive answer as to whether the paper should be accepted or rejected, I think it is important for the authors to address these concerns through the revisions to the paper. If they can provide stronger evidence for the effectiveness of their method through additional experiments and analysis, then the paper may be more convincing to Reviewer 1 and other reviewers as well. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on your responses and the reviews, I have decided to request a major revision from the authors. They should address the concerns and suggestions raised by the reviewers, and provide additional experiments and analysis as necessary to strengthen the paper.
