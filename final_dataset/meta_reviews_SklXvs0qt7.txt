Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have read through the reviews for the paper "Curiosity-Driven Experience Prioritization via Density Estimation", and I have some questions before making a decision about whether to accept or reject it.

Dialogue Agent: I'll do my best to answer your questions based on the reviews and the information provided.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 mentioned that the paper lacked clarity on certain design decisions, such as the choice of the VGMM model. Can you provide any additional information on why this model was chosen and how it compares to other density estimators?

Dialogue Agent: I'm sorry, but as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that Review 1 suggested that this information could be beneficial for the paper and should be included in earlier sections.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 2 mentioned a concern regarding the mechanism provided for importance weighting having no mathematical justification. Is there any additional information on this concern or any other mathematical issues with the paper that were not mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: I do not have additional information on these concerns. However, Review 2 did mention that stating a desirable property of the sampling mechanism and arguing informally that this mechanism has this property could be useful for the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Review 3 mentioned issues with estimating rank from a density estimator, as well as generalization and scaling issues. Are there any additional details on these concerns or ways in which they could be addressed?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 did not provide additional details. However, they did mention that the paper could benefit from addressing these issues and providing more information on how they impact the method proposed in the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews and the information provided, do you have any recommendations or opinions regarding whether the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue Agent: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide recommendations or opinions as I am a dialogue agent and must refrain from doing so. However, I can provide the ratings and confidence levels from the reviews. Review 1 rated the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold with a confidence level of 3, while Review 2 rated the paper as ok but not good enough for publication with a confidence level of 4. Review 3 also rated the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold with a confidence level of 4.
