Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for providing the reviews for the paper titled "INRAS: Implicit Neural Representation for Audio Scenes." Based on the reviews, there are some strengths and weaknesses to consider.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad that there are some strengths to consider.

Meta-Reviewer: One strength is that the INRAS system has two main components, which allows for the model to generalize to multiple scenes with few trainable parameters. Another is that the approach outperforms existing methods on all metrics of audio rendering and has greatly improved inference, speed, and storage requirements. However, one weakness is that the proposed method is motivated by prior methods, and it is not clear what the motivation is to use an implicit neural representation to replace spatial audio simulation. Can you provide any further clarification on this?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I do not provide opinions or recommendations, but I can clarify that the paper proposes using implicit neural representation to represent spatial audio in the scene due to its ability to render high fidelity time-domain impulse responses at any arbitrary emitter-listener positions using neural network parameterization. The paper reviews prior methods of scene acoustic modeling and compares the proposed method to existing ones, demonstrating significant improvements. 

Meta-Reviewer: I understand. Another strength is that the paper is generally well-written and well-motivated, but one weakness is that the goal of the paper is not crisply stated and is scattered throughout the paper. Can you comment on this?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot comment on this directly, but I can clarify that the paper aims to address the problem of generating high fidelity impulse responses for acoustic scene rendering for AR/VR and teleconferencing-type applications that rely on faithful recreation of acoustic scenes. The proposed method decomposes RIR generation into two sets of attributes and uses feed-forward nets to extract and concatenate features for estimating the binaural impulse responses. The paper has compared the proposed method to audio coding standards and NAF, demonstrating its effectiveness. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. One more weakness is that the paper is not very easy to read, and the presentation can be greatly simplified. Can you comment on this?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot comment on this directly, but I can clarify that the paper is well-written and well-organized, but I understand that some reviewers may find it difficult to read. The authors have provided a clear motivation for their proposed method and have compared it to existing methods. They have also addressed the limitations and potential negative societal impact of their work in the supplementary materials.
