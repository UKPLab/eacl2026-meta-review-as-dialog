 Sure, here is a dialogue between a dialogue agent and a meta-reviewer assessing a paper for acceptance or rejection, based on the provided review. The meta-reviewer is aware only of the paper's title, and the dialogue agent refrains from opinions or recommendations.

Dialogue Agent: Hello, I'm here to assist you with assessing a paper for acceptance or rejection. Can you please provide the paper's title?

Meta-Reviewer: Sure, the paper is titled "FedMes: Speeding Up Federated Learning with Multiple Edge Servers".

Dialogue Agent: Great! Based on the title, I can see that the paper is focused on improving the efficiency of federated learning with multiple edge servers. Can you tell me more about the paper and your concerns?

Meta-Reviewer: Well, I have some concerns about the novelty of the proposed approach and the lack of empirical evaluation. The idea of using multiple edge servers to improve the efficiency of federated learning is not new, and the authors don't provide enough evidence to support their claims.

Dialogue Agent: I see. Can you tell me more about your concerns regarding the novelty of the proposed approach?

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, I think that the authors have not provided enough detail about how their approach differs from existing methods, and how it addresses the challenges of federated learning with multiple edge servers. The paper seems to be more of an extension of previous work rather than a novel contribution.

Dialogue Agent: I understand. Can you tell me more about your concerns regarding the lack of empirical evaluation?

Meta-Reviewer: Sure. The authors only provide a limited set of experiments, and they do not adequately address the challenges of federated learning with multiple edge servers. For example, they do not consider the impact of device mobility, network latency, or interference on their proposed approach. Additionally, they do not provide enough details about the experimental setup and the data used for evaluation.

Dialogue Agent: I see. Based on your concerns, it seems that the paper may not meet the standards for acceptance. However, I would like to hear from the authors to see if they can address your concerns. Can you provide me with your final decision regarding the paper?

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, based on the limited information provided, I would recommend rejecting the paper. However, I would be willing to reconsider if the authors can provide more details about their approach and address my concerns through empirical evaluation.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your time and input. I will forward your concerns to the authors and see if they can address them.
