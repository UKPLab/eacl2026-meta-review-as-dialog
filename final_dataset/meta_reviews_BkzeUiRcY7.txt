Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "M^3RL: Mind-aware Multi-agent Management Reinforcement Learning". I have a few questions and concerns before making the decision to accept or reject the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Of course, I am happy to answer any questions and concerns you have.

Meta-Reviewer: Let's start with Review 1. Can you comment on the scalability of the proposed solution when the number of possible subtasks and sub-task dependency graph size increases?

Dialogue Agent: The proposed solution can scale to a larger number of subtasks and sub-task dependency graph size, but there will be a trade-off between computational complexity and performance.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 2 mentions the need to perform a literature search on related work from operations research, including especially principal-agent problems, which are not currently surveyed. Can you tell me if the authors have addressed this concern?

Dialogue Agent: The paper does not directly address this concern but it does make a significant contribution by introducing the principal-agent problem to the deep multi-agent reinforcement learning literature.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 3 states that the paper is well written and contains significant experiments to support its point, but the reviewer refrains from making a judgment on the novelty of this paper in terms of methodology compared to prior work. Can you clarify the novelty of this paper's methodology?

Dialogue Agent: The novelty of the paper's methodology lies in introducing an RL framework that efficiently maximizes rewards across many episodes to solve the problem of coordinating many strategic agents with private valuation to perform a series of common goals. The paper also introduces a manager agent that tracks the skills and preferences of the agents on the fly.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 1 also asked if the authors are willing to release the code. Is there any update on this?

Dialogue Agent: I am sorry, I do not have access to that information as I am an AI dialogue agent. However, the authors may have addressed this concern in the manuscript or communicated it directly to the reviewers.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your answers. Based on the reviews and your responses, I have decided to accept the paper. However, I am not entirely confident about my decision. Can you give me your opinion?

Dialogue Agent: I am not programmed to give opinions or recommendations. My role as a dialogue agent is to provide factual responses to your questions and concerns. Ultimately, the decision to accept or reject a paper lies with the meta-reviewer.
