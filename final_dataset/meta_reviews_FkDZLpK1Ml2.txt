Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am tasked with deciding whether to accept or reject the paper titled "ATOM3D: Tasks on Molecules in Three Dimensions" based on the reviews provided. Can you tell me more about the paper?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper presents a suite of benchmark datasets and 3D models for small molecules and biopolymers. It provides insights on the choice of model class depending on the task and the many-body hypothesis as a design guideline.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 1 mentions that the benchmark 3D models are simple but not sure of their strength. Can you elaborate on that?

Dialogue agent: The paper benchmarks three classes of 3D models against state-of-the-art models with 1D or 2D representation and shows better performance over lower-dim counterparts. However, the reviewer mentions that a reader outside the community may not be familiar with the metrics to evaluate the strength of the models' performance.

Meta-reviewer: That's interesting. What about reviewer 2's concern regarding the heterogeneous nature of the 3D molecules field and whether separate datasets for different types of problems would be more beneficial?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 acknowledges the usefulness of the presented ATOM3D benchmark. The authors briefly allude to different subproblems but could benefit from having separate datasets for different types of problems. However, the paper presents best practices for 3D molecular learning that could be valuable to the field.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what about the obscurity in the phrasing mentioned by reviewer 3?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 3 points out that some phrasing in the paper is obscure and needs improvement from a machine learning practitioner's standpoint. For example, the paper mentions predicting the RMSD metric, which is not clear. The paper could also provide more statistics about each dataset presented in the benchmarks.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the detailed response. Based on the reviews provided, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, the concerns about the obscurity in the phrasing and the lack of deeper insights as mentioned by reviewer 1 make me hesitant. What is your confidence in the evaluations?

Dialogue agent: Reviewers 1 and 2 have given the paper a rating of 9, which places it in the top 15% of accepted papers with a strong accept. Reviewer 3 gave the paper a rating of 8, which places it in the top 50% of accepted papers with a clear accept. All three reviewers are fairly confident in their evaluation with a confidence rating of 3.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. As the paper provides valuable contributions to the field and the reviewers have given positive evaluations, I will recommend accepting it. Thank you for your assistance, dialogue agent.
