Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper titled "DeepOBS: A Deep Learning Optimizer Benchmark Suite". I have reviewed the three reviews provided and would like to ask some questions to help me make my final decision on whether to accept or reject this paper. Are you ready to answer my questions?

Dialogue agent: Yes, I am ready to answer your questions.

Meta-reviewer: Great. Reviewer 1 mentioned several issues with the paper, such as the lack of a sound hyper-parameter optimization procedure and sound interpretation tools. How would you respond to this?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can confirm that the paper does mention the importance of hyper-parameter tuning and provides baselines built with grid search. The paper also presents interpretability tools such as the visualization in Figure 2. It is important to note that the paper presents a benchmark suite, which can serve as a starting point for future work to improve hyper-parameter optimization and interpretability.

Meta-reviewer: Fair enough. Reviewer 2 mentioned that the paper is valuable for proposing a unified benchmarking framework, but will require tremendous efforts to convince others to join the project. How would you respond to this?

Dialogue agent: While it is true that there is a need for community engagement for this project to succeed, the authors have already released the code and made it open source, which can help encourage community contributions. The paper itself has been well-written and understandable, which can also help with community adoption. Ultimately, the value of having a common benchmarking framework for deep learning optimizers cannot be underestimated.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the response. Reviewer 3 provided a positive review and recommended accepting the paper. Can you provide any additional information on the value of the proposed benchmark suite?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper proposes a benchmark suite specifically designed for deep learning optimizer evaluations, which is a significant contribution given the current lack of a standard system for benchmarking such optimizers. The paper includes 20 test problems and well-tuned baselines, which aims to provide a canonical set of tasks for evaluating and comparing optimizers. The benchmark suite is also customizable and can serve as a foundation for future work in the field.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on these reviews and your responses, I have a better understanding of the paper. What is your recommendation on whether to accept or reject this paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide recommendations. However, I can inform you that the confidence levels for the reviews range from a 4 to a 7. Reviewer 1 provided a score of 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold. Reviewers 2 and 3 both recommended accepting the paper. As the meta-reviewer, it is up to you to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in making the final decision.
