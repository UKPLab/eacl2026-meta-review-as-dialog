Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for providing me with the reviews for this paper. Based on the reviews, it seems like this paper has some strengths in terms of its well-written description of the problem it addresses and the methods it uses to achieve its goals. However, there are also some concerns raised by the reviewers, particularly in regards to the originality and generalizability of the work, as well as the clarity of certain aspects of the paper. Given these mixed signals, I'm having difficulty making a decision about whether to recommend acceptance or rejection. Can you shed some light on these issues and help me come to a conclusion?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. As a dialogue agent, I can only provide you with facts and specific details related to the reviews and the paper, but I will do my best to assist you in making a decision.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. One of the main concerns raised by Reviewer 3 is that this paper may not have enough original research content to be suitable for ICLR. Can you provide more information on the specific contributions made by the authors?

Dialogue Agent: The authors of this paper developed two main contributions. The first contribution is an implementation of sparse-full convolutions, which enables fast convolution routines for sparse convolution weights in the case of general sparsity. This has previously been achieved only for structured sparsity. The second contribution is a model for evaluating the potential speed-up of different sparsity levels for CNNs. This differs from previous pruning methods, which have typically focused on saving memory with modest speed gains. By imbuing knowledge of running speed into a pruning algorithm, the authors are able to achieve improved performance.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that information. Reviewers 1 and 2 both noted that the paper had strengths in terms of its methodology and evaluations, but that there was some lack of clarity in the paper. Can you provide more information on specific areas that the reviewers pointed out for improvement?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 requested a concise summary of the speedup/memory gains achievable with this new work compared with previously published work. While the authors do show the various sparsity levels obtained with various methods of pruning, it is unclear how to translate the information given in the paper into an understanding of gains relative to other methods. Reviewer 2 mentioned that the points in Figure 4 are hard to distinguish, and that overall the figure could be made larger. The reviewer also requested clarification on whether the "base learning rate" in Section 3 is the start or end rate of the annealing schedule, and reported a few typos. Finally, Reviewer 2 suggested that the evaluation could benefit from a discussion of how transferable the performance model is to GPUs.

Meta-Reviewer: Thanks for the clarification. It seems like the paper has some areas that could be improved to increase its clarity and accessibility to readers, but that the methodology itself is sound and provides a useful contribution to the field. Based on the reviews and information you've provided, I believe that the paper should be accepted with the stipulation that the authors make the necessary revisions to clarify some of the issues raised by the reviewers.

Dialogue Agent: Understood. I will pass on your decision to the authors. Thank you for your time.
