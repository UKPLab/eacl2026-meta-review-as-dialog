Buyer: Hi there. Can you tell me about Crayola Washable Super Tips?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! Crayola Washable Super Tips Markers are versatile art tools with lots of fun colors. They can be used to draw, write, and color in various projects and are washable, so you don't have to worry about stains.

Buyer: That's great to hear. Are they easy to use?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, they have a fine tip designed for detailed work and a broad tip for coloring and filling-in. Many reviewers have found them to be excellent for kids, homeschool, and adult coloring books. 

Buyer: Do the colors match the caps?

Dialogue Agent: Some reviewers have mentioned that the colors are slightly off and suggest testing them first. However, the caps are pretty close to the actual color of the ink.

Buyer: Are they long-lasting? 

Dialogue Agent: Yes, they are! Many reviewers have commented on how long they last and hold up to frequent use, even after a week of heavy use by ten kids.

Buyer: How about washing them off?

Dialogue Agent: They are washable, but some reviewers have noted that you still need quite a few washes with soap to get color off hands. On the other hand, they wash right out of fabrics and off furniture and walls!

Buyer: Is there anything that I should know before making a final decision?

Dialogue Agent: Some reviewers have mentioned that the caps are hard to get off and really hard to put on the bottom of the marker once you get the cap off. Also, the nib of one of the markers snapped on its first use. However, most reviewers have overall been satisfied with their purchase and consider it to be a great product for the price.

Buyer: Thank you for letting me know. I think I'll go ahead and give them a try!

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy using them.
