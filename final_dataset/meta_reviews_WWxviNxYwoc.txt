Meta-reviewer: I appreciate the feedback. Can you provide some more information on the paper's contributions and limitations?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper presents a novel problem area and potential ways of addressing it, which is its main contribution. However, reviewers have pointed out that its visualization concepts and formative studies are not strong enough and should be further developed and evaluated. The paper also has some limitations, which include the need to consider contextual challenges beyond the low-fidelity paper prototypes used in testing the visualization concepts and the need to account for other types of visual information that must be taken into consideration when designing the visualization concepts.

Meta-reviewer: Thanks for summarizing that. Can you tell me more about the reviewers' specific suggestions for improvement?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Reviewer 1 suggested several minor changes that could improve the paper, including restructuring some sections for greater clarity and presenting information in ranges instead of specific values to avoid identifying participants. Reviewer 2 suggested that the authors review more related literature and expand their evaluation beyond low-fidelity paper prototypes. Reviewer 3 suggested that the authors acknowledge certain limitations, such as contextual challenges in testing the visualization concepts, and address additional visual information that must be considered in their design.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on these reviews, what is your recommendation for acceptance or rejection?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I don't make recommendations or provide opinions. However, I can provide information on the reviewers' opinions to help you make a decision in light of their evaluations.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews, I think the paper has interesting potential and may still need to be refined. I will consider its strengths and limitations before making a final decision.
