Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you tell me more about the reviews for the paper "Neural Collapse with Normalized Features: A Geometric Analysis over the Riemannian Manifold"?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Review 1 points out that while the motivation of interpreting feature normalization from the perspective of neural collapse is interesting, there is a limited contribution. The experimental results are used to verify theoretical results, but it is unclear why normalization provides an advantage over regularization. The reviewer raises concerns about the significance of the first theoretical result, which is a minor extension of another paper with spherical constraint.

Review 2 acknowledges the clarity and organization of the paper. Furthermore, the experiments support the claims that the author makes. However, according to this review, the main theoretical contribution is not groundbreaking, as the proof of Theorem 1 on neural collapse properties is not too different from existing methods. Despite this, Theorem 2 regarding the global landscape is nontrivial and useful.

Review 3 considers the paper's formulation of neural collapse in the case where features are normalized to be interesting. However, the review challenges the organization of the paper and the related work section, as the main result is neither introduced or motivated. Furthermore, important related works are missing, as the paper does not explore how normalization achieves separability. The review notes a lack of intuition and motivation surrounding the oblique manifold formulation and suggests improving the paper's self-containment.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on these critiques, I have some questions. What can you say about the confidence levels of the reviews, and is there a specific comment or concern you would like to address?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the confidence levels of the meta-reviewer's assessments vary. The confidence level for Review 1 is 3, indicating some uncertainty about the assessment. Review 2 also has some uncertainty and a moderate level of confidence at 2. Review 3 has a high level of confidence at 4. It is important to note that Review 3 points out the lack of motivation and intuition surrounding the oblique manifold formulation, which could be addressed to make the paper more comprehensible. Furthermore, adding a more detailed discussion of related works could help readers better understand the significance of results and how normalization achieves separability.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on these reviews, it seems that the paper has a technically solid foundation, but could use some improvements in terms of organization, explanation, and discussion of related works. I am somewhat stuck on how to rate this paper. Can you give me some recommendations or guidance in this decision-making process?

Dialogue Agent: While it is ultimately up to the meta-reviewer to decide, I would suggest that the paper is likely a weak accept, given its technically solid foundation and contribution to understanding neural collapse in the context of normalized features. However, the issues surrounding organization, explainability, and related works raised in review 3 may warrant a lower rating. It is worth considering which aspects matter most, such as technical soundness versus potential impact of the paper, in weighing the final decision.
