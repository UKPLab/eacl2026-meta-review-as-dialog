Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you give me a summary of the reviews for the paper NOODL: Provable Online Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding?

Dialogue agent: Sure, the paper considers the problem of dictionary learning and shows that there is an alternating optimization-based algorithm that provably converges exactly to the true dictionary and coefficients. Reviewer 1 compared the paper to a prior work and found it to be a nice and non-trivial result, but had difficulty verifying the dense proofs. Reviewer 2 found the paper to be well-written and relevant, but suggested more intuitive explanations and clarification on computational time. Reviewer 3 thought that the algorithmic novelty could have been described more explicitly and suggested more extensive experimental results.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you also remind me of the paper type and ratings for each review?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper is a long paper, and the ratings for each review are: Reviewer 1 gave a rating of 7 and has a confidence of 2. Reviewer 2 gave a rating of 6 and has a confidence of 2. Reviewer 3 gave a rating of 7 and has a confidence of 2.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that information. Based on these reviews, it seems that there are both positive and negative aspects to the paper. Can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. A confidence level of 2 indicates that the reviewer is willing to defend their evaluation, but it is quite likely that they did not understand central parts of the paper. So while the reviewers have some level of confidence in their evaluations, they may not fully understand all aspects of the paper.

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful to know. Can you remind me of the main contribution of the paper and the compared prior work?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the main contribution of the paper is the use of an IHT-based strategy to update the coefficients and a gradient-based update for the dictionary (NOODL algorithm), combined with proper initialization, which has exact recovery guarantees. The main compared prior work is Arora et al. 2015, which uses algorithms of similar type with some differences in assumptions.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, thank you. Based on these reviews, it seems like the paper has some strengths and weaknesses. I'm curious about the confidence level of the positive review that gave a rating of 7. Do they seem more confident in their evaluation than the other reviewers?

Dialogue agent: While the positive review gave a higher rating, their confidence level of 2 indicates they may not have fully understood the central parts of the paper. So I would not say that they are significantly more confident in their evaluation than the other reviewers.

Meta-reviewer: I see, thank you for clarifying that. Overall, it seems like the paper has some strengths and weaknesses, and the reviewers have varying levels of confidence in their evaluations. I will take all of this into consideration when making my decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.
