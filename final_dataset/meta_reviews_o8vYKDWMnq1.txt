Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for being here today. I have read the reviews for the paper "Understanding Deep Neural Function Approximation in Reinforcement Learning via $\epsilon$-Greedy Exploration" and I would like to get your perspective on the paper.

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I am glad to be here to help you with your decision. What questions do you have about the paper?

Meta-reviewer: Can you summarize the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue agent: The paper provides a theoretical study of deep Q-networks (DQN) in the online and episodic Markov decision process (MDP) model with $\epsilon$-greedy exploration. The authors focus on Besov and Barron function spaces in approximating an $\alpha$ smooth Q-function. Under some assumptions, they prove that DQN with shallow layers and medium width can learn the MDP with sublinear regret. The paper also provides guidelines for the scaling of the neural network width and depth for achieving the sublinear regret. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, that is helpful. Review 1 mentioned potential limitations of the paper due to the requirement to optimize a neural network function. Can you provide more information on how the authors addressed this concern?

Dialogue agent: The authors acknowledged the potential issue of optimization and have discussed it in the paper. However, they did not provide a specific solution for the problem. Instead, they focused on providing theoretical guarantees for the case when the optimization problem is solved optimally.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 2 mentioned some missing literature on theoretical analysis of Q-learning algorithms. Can you elaborate on that?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 mentioned that the paper did not discuss some existing literature on theoretical analysis of Q-learning algorithms, such as the papers by Jin et al. and Xu et al. The authors did not address these papers in their paper, but it is possible that they are aware of them and decided not to discuss them.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, thank you. Review 3 raised some concerns about the assumptions made in the paper. Can you provide more details on that?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 mentioned that the paper heavily relied on the assumption of probabilistic sufficient exploration, which may not be practical in real-life scenarios. Review 3 also pointed out that the value iteration algorithm with neural networks is rarely used in practice, and there may be a gap between the theoretical results and practical algorithms. The authors did acknowledge these issues in the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your answers. Based on the reviews and your responses, I believe the paper is technically solid and has moderate-to-high impact. However, I am concerned about the potential limitations and the reliability of the results in practical applications. Therefore, I have decided to give the paper a rating of 6: Weak Accept.

Dialogue agent: Understood, meta-reviewer. Thank you for your decision.
