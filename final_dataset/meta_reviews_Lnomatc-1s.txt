Meta-Reviewer: I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Learning-Augmented Sketches for Hessians," and I have some questions regarding the reviews and the paper. Firstly, can the dialogue agent provide a brief summary of the paper and its contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, certainly. The paper proposes a learned variant of the iterative Hessian sketch method for efficiently solving least-squares regression. The learned method is essentially a variant of the count-sketch, where the positions of the non-zero entries are random while the value is learned. The paper's contribution is primarily experimental, showing that the learned sketches can improve the convergence rate of second-order optimization methods in comparison to other baseline methods.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Review 1 seems to be somewhat critical but its confidence level is low. Can you elaborate on why the confidence level is low and whether their concerns are valid?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 had some concerns about the paper's technical novelty, which they felt was incremental. However, they did acknowledge the learned sketch's better convergence rate in experiments. Their main questions were about the experiment's methodology, such as the running time of the learned sketch compared to other baselines. I believe Reviewer 1's concerns are valid, although their confidence level is low; nevertheless, their questions are answerable, and their concerns can be addressed.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 2 has provided a comprehensive evaluation of the paper, and it seems to be generally positive with some concerns. Can you summarize their advantages and concerns, and whether their evaluation is credible?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Reviewer 2 generally found the idea of learned sketches interesting and appreciated the balance between theory, algorithms, and experiments. They did have several concerns regarding the paper's technical details, particularly in Lemma 3.1 and Theorem 3.2, which they felt contained errors. Reviewer 2's evaluation is credible, and their concerns should be taken seriously.

Meta-Reviewer: Finally, Review 3 seems to be skeptical of the paper's contributions and its approach. Can you summarize their concerns, and whether they are valid or not?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3 was skeptical of the learned Hessian sketch's practicality due to the resulting computational overhead. They also felt that the numerical results presented by the authors were misleading due to issues with vertical views and exaggerated claims. Reviewer 3 felt that the paper's theoretical contributions were incremental and that the analysis should focus more on the learned sketch's convergence in relation to the training data. Reviewer 3's concerns seem valid and should be addressed.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Overall, do you believe that the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper has some valid contributions and interesting ideas, but there are also concerns and issues that need to be addressed. Therefore, it would be best to ask the authors to revise the paper and address the reviewers' comments before making a final decision on acceptance or rejection.
