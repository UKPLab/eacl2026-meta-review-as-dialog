Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "HierSpeech: Bridging the Gap between Text and Speech by Hierarchical Variational Inference using Self-supervised Representations for Speech Synthesis," and I have a few questions to help me make a decision. Can you confirm for me the type of paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the type of the paper is long.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Now, Review 1 points out a weakness in the formulation of the acoustic VAE about the weights sharing between the acoustic prior and the linguistic posterior, which is critical but not part of the ELBO equation. Have the authors addressed this weakness?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 does mention this weakness, and the authors have discussed it in the paper. They have also provided mitigation strategies to address this issue.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for confirming that. Review 2 says that there is no obvious weakness in the paper. Is there anything that I should be aware of before making a decision?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 provides a positive evaluation of the paper and does not mention any major concerns. However, as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations.

Meta-reviewer: Understood, thank you. Now, Review 3 mentions that some details are missing and has a question section. Have the authors addressed these questions and provided the missing details?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 does have some questions and mentions missing details, but the authors have addressed them in the paper and provided mitigation strategies as appropriate.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on these reviews, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. However, I am curious about the confidence levels of the reviewers. What are the confidence levels for each review?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 has a confidence level of 3, Review 2 has a confidence level of 3, and Review 3 has a confidence level of 4.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. I will take this into consideration when making my final decision.
