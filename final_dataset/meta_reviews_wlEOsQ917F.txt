Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today. I have read the reviews for the paper "A framework for bilevel optimization that enables stochastic and global variance reduction algorithms" and I have a few questions for you.

Dialogue Agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. I will do my best to answer your questions based on the reviews and the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Great. Let's start with the paper type. Review 1 mentions that the paper is long. Can you confirm that?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, meta-reviewer. The paper is indeed a long paper.

Meta-reviewer: Alright. Now, I see in Review 1 that the paper proposes two methods: SOBA and SABA. Can you explain how these methods differ and what advantages they offer?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. SOBA updates $x, z, v$ similarly to single-level SGD and uses two-timescales decreasing step-sizes for the inner and outer variable, while SABA uses variance reduction with constant step-sizes, similar to SAGA. They offer advantages such as achieving optimal convergence rates and outperforming other bilevel methods in experiments.

Meta-reviewer: That's interesting. Review 1 also mentions that there are some weaknesses in the paper. One of them is the discrepancy between the proposed algorithm and how it is actually implemented. Can you explain this further?

Dialogue Agent: The rolling average used in practice for the variance reduction is not covered by the theory, as pointed out by Review 1. This is a limitation of the paper, and the authors did not thoroughly address this point in their revision and response.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 2 mentions that the key idea of this framework is not novel. What is this key idea, and how does the paper contribute to it?

Dialogue Agent: The key idea is the way of estimating the Hessian-vector product, i.e., 'v' (equation (5) in the text). The paper contributes to this idea by proposing a matrix-inversion-free framework that is convenient and implementation-friendly.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for clarifying that. Now, Review 3 mentions that the main theorems in the paper only discuss iteration complexity instead of sample complexity, which is more appropriate for finite-sum/stochastic optimization problems. Can you explain the difference between iteration complexity and sample complexity, and why sample complexity is more appropriate in this context?

Dialogue Agent: Iteration complexity refers to the number of iterations required for an algorithm to converge to a solution, whereas sample complexity refers to the number of samples required for an algorithm to converge to a solution. Sample complexity is more appropriate in the context of finite-sum/stochastic optimization problems because the number of samples is usually much larger than the number of iterations required for convergence.

Meta-reviewer: That makes sense. And finally, Review 3 mentions that the theoretical result does not justify the reason for using variance reduction. Can you explain why variance reduction is used in this paper and how it contributes to the proposed framework?

Dialogue Agent: Variance reduction is used to reduce the variance of the stochastic gradient estimates used in the algorithm, which leads to faster convergence rates and better performance. The paper contributes to this by proposing a variance reduction-based framework that achieves optimal convergence rates and outperforms other bilevel methods in experiments.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for explaining that. Based on the reviews and your answers, I think I have enough information to make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.

Dialogue Agent: I'm glad I could assist you, meta-reviewer. Please let me know what your decision is.

Meta-reviewer: After carefully considering the reviews and your answers to my questions, I have decided to accept this paper with a strong rating of 8. While there are some weaknesses and limitations that are not thoroughly addressed, the paper is technically strong and provides a novel framework for bilevel optimization with good evaluation and resources. The experiments show promising results, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. Thank you for your help, dialogue agent.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. I'm glad I could assist you in making a decision.
