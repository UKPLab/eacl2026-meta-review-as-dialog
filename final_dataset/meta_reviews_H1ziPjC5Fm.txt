 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper. The title of the paper is "Visual Explanation by Interpretation: Improving Visual Feedback Capabilities of Deep Neural Networks." The type of the paper is long. The reviews are [Review 1: Pros: This paper - Proposes a method for producing visual explanations for deep neural network outputs, - Improves quality of the guided backprop approach for strided layers by converting stride 2 layers to stride 1 and resampling inputs (improving on a longstanding difficulty with such approaches), - Shows fairly rigorous experimentation demonstrating the applicability and properties of the proposed approach, and - Releases a new synthetic dataset and benchmark for visual explanation methods. Although producing visual explanations is a task fraught with difficulty for many reasons, including that explanations for complex decisions may not necessarily be communicable via one or a small number of saliency maps over the image pixels, this paper strives valiantly in this admittedly difficult direction. The experimentation is fairly rigorous, which is a welcome departure from and improvement on the norm for this type of paper. I hope such more quantitative evaluation will become more common in papers evaluating visual explanations. Cons: What about features that are very important but not linearly predictive on their own? This approach (and many others) would not work in that case; recognizing this, extending the an8Flower dataset to include such images and labels may be motivating for the field. For example, flowers where the class is determined not by a specific single color or feature (thorns or spots) but by the combination. In these cases, it's not clear what the right answer would even be in the form of a saliency map, so the first task for researchers would be to determine in what format the answer should even be provided! So: less a benchmark than a motivating open question.

Meta-reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing the paper "Visual Explanation by Interpretation: Improving Visual Feedback Capabilities of Deep Neural Networks." Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a method for producing visual explanations for deep neural network outputs. The method improves the quality of the guided backprop approach for strided layers by converting stride 2 layers to stride 1 and resampling inputs. This approach improves the applicability and properties of the proposed approach, and the paper releases a new synthetic dataset and benchmark for visual explanation methods.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the experimentation in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper shows fairly rigorous experimentation demonstrating the applicability and properties of the proposed approach. The experimentation is fairly rigorous, which is a welcome departure from and improvement on the norm for this type of paper. I hope such more quantitative evaluation will become more common in papers evaluating visual explanations.

Meta-reviewer: What are some potential limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: One potential limitation is that the paper does not address features that are very important but not linearly predictive on their own. This approach (and many others) would not work in that case; recognizing this, extending the an8Flower dataset to include such images and labels may be motivating for the field. For example, flowers where the class is determined not by a specific single color or feature (thorns or spots) but by the combination. In these cases, it's not clear what the right answer would even be in the form of a saliency map, so the first task for researchers would be to determine in what format the answer should even be provided!

Meta-reviewer: That's a good point. Can you tell me more about the synthetic dataset released with the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper releases a new synthetic dataset and benchmark for visual explanation methods. The synthetic dataset is created by converting stride 2 layers to stride 1 and resampling inputs, which improves the quality of the guided backprop approach for strided layers. The benchmark is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of visual explanation methods for deep neural network outputs.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds like a useful resource for the community. Can you tell me more about the ratings and confidence of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has a rating of 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold and a confidence of 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct. The reviewers are aware of the relevant literature and have provided thoughtful and constructive feedback.
