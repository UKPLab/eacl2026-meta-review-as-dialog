Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "Locally Linear Unsupervised Feature Selection". I have a few questions for the dialogue agent before I make a decision.

Dialogue Agent: Of course, please go ahead.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 1 mentioned that the paper did not clearly explain the novelty and motivation behind the proposed method. Can you explain why the authors chose to use LLE instead of other feature selection methods, and what advantages the proposed method has over existing methods?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot offer opinions or recommendations on why the authors chose LLE specifically or what advantages the proposed method has. I can only provide information from the reviews and the paper itself.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 2 asked why the authors only used autoencoder neural network for dimension reduction. Were other techniques like PCA or SVD considered? Can you provide any information on this?

Dialogue Agent: According to Reviewer 2, they suggest that the authors compare the performance of the proposed method with other dimension reduction techniques like PCA or SVD. However, the paper itself does not provide any information on whether these other techniques were considered.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 3 raised some concerns about the assumptions behind the proposed method and the lack of theoretical guarantees. What can you tell me about this?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3 mentioned that there are some shortcomings in the motivation of the approach, and they are not convinced with the experimental study. Additionally, they have concerns about the assumptions made in the paper and the lack of theoretical guarantees on the performance of the method.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews, it seems that there are some concerns about the novelty and motivation of the proposed method, as well as its theoretical guarantees. However, Reviewer 2 marginally recommends acceptance. How confident is Reviewer 2 in their evaluation?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2 has a confidence score of 2 out of 10, which means there is a higher likelihood that they did not fully understand central parts of the paper.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews and considering the importance of theoretical guarantees in this field, I have decided to reject the paper. Thank you for your help, dialogue agent.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer.
