Meta-reviewer: Can you explain to me the main contributions of the paper and the significance of these contributions?

Dialogue agent: The paper proposes MoVQ, a VQ-GAN model that improves image generation through spatial normalization of quantized vectors, MaskGIT, and multichannel feature quantization. The main contribution is the proposal to modulate quantized vectors through spatially conditional normalization to improve reconstruction performance. Additionally, they propose the use of several channels of quantized features to subdivide the encoded continuous latent and quantize them with the same shared codebook, which further enhances reconstruction performance. The authors show that their method has better reconstruction performance and comparable or worse results on image synthesis. As for significance, improving only the first stage of image generation, as done in MoVQ, is an important problem that can have implications on many applications, including image synthesis, in- and out-painting, text-to-image, and video synthesis. That being said, the paper needs to be improved to demonstrate that their contribution leads to improvements compared to previous work.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you elaborate on the weaknesses mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 mentions that the paper is not always careful in its comparison to other methods, and more careful use of common tools from compression literature would help clarify some of the comparisons across methods. Additionally, the reviewer raises concerns about the image of the child in Figure 4, where the child's face has changed significantly from the original but does not betray any indication to the downstream user that the image has lost information or is in any sense uncertain. This raises implications that the paper does not address adequately. Review 2 notes that while the paper is technically sound, the novelty is somewhat limited, and the evaluation is somewhat limited, with the paper heavily relying on existing techniques such as multichannel representation and MaskGIT. The reviewer suggests that improving the reconstruction performance does not necessarily improve the generation performance, and the experimental evaluation should report FID with or without the proposed spatially conditional normalization. Review 3 argues that while the paper addresses an interesting, competitive problem, the support behind the claim of repetitive content due to quantization is inadequate. Additionally, the paper needs to demonstrate how the proposed contributions lead to improvements compared to previous work and to other downstream tasks, besides reconstruction.

Meta-reviewer: Taking all of these reviews into account, what is your overall assessment of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, Review 1 rates the paper 7, which means it is technically solid with high impact on at least one sub-area, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations. Review 2 rates the paper 5, which is borderline accept, where reasons to accept outweigh reasons to reject, e.g., limited evaluation. However, the novelty is somewhat limited. Review 3 rates the paper 4, which is borderline reject, where reasons to reject, e.g., limited evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept, e.g., good evaluation. Considering all of these reviews, we can conclude that while the paper addresses an important and competitive problem and proposes interesting contributions, it needs to address some of the limitations mentioned by the reviewers.
