 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Post-hoc estimators for learning to defer to an expert":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Post-hoc estimators for learning to defer to an expert". Can you please provide a summary of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper addresses the problem of learning to defer, in which a machine learning model learns when to defer the decision on an instance to an expert based on an estimate of the expert's cost. The authors propose two post-hoc strategies that prevent oversmoothing and achieve high performance in the setting involving fixed costs.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper identifies a structural limitation of recent solutions that seriously affects their applicability to real-world scenarios. The proposed solution is theoretically grounded and easy to implement. A careful experimental evaluation confirms the substantial advantage of the proposed post-hoc approaches compared to state-of-the-art solutions. However, the solution is a post-hoc strategy, and the base model is trained in a simpler setting with zero fixed cost.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the authors' main contributions, and how do they compare to previous work?

Dialogue Agent: The authors propose two post-hoc strategies that prevent oversmoothing and achieve high performance in the setting involving fixed costs. The proposed solution is theoretically grounded and easy to implement. The authors also provide a careful experimental evaluation that confirms the substantial advantage of the proposed post-hoc approaches compared to state-of-the-art solutions.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. What are the limitations of the proposed solution, and how could they be addressed?

Dialogue Agent: The solution is a post-hoc strategy, and the base model is trained in a simpler setting with zero fixed cost. There is not much discussion on the limitations of the proposed solution. My suggestion is to add something on the limitations of a two-step strategy and possibly hinting at future directions for a fully joint learning setting that also prevents oversmoothing.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on your summary, I would rate this paper as "Accept" with a confidence level of 4.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad I could assist you in reviewing this paper. If you have any further questions or need any more information, please don't hesitate to ask.
