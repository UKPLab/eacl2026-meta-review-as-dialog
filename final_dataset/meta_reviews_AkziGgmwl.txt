Meta-reviewer: Hello there, can you tell me about the paper's strengths and weaknesses based on the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, Review 1 highlights the novelty of this approach, which emphasizes on the regions near the lobe boundary with a weighted Dice coefficient. However, it's important to note that this approach has been done before in Gerard et al. Review 2 suggests that the weighting based on Euclidean distance transform is a useful idea, and the paper's weaknesses lie in the lack of thorough validation and discussion of the improvements due to weighting, and the results are not convincing. Finally, Review 3 points out that some of the claims made in the introduction are not entirely accurate. Explicit knowledge from pulmonary fissures has been used in existing approaches, and a lung segmentation is required in the proposed method as a precursor. Inference patch size is also unclear, and the calculation of mean distance to visible fissure is ambiguous.

Meta-reviewer: The reviewers seem to have differing levels of confidence in their evaluations. How important is this confidence level in making the final decision?

Dialogue agent: Reviewers' confidence levels are certainly important and should be considered in the final decision. However, they are only one aspect to consider among many other factors, such as the paper's novelty, strengths, and weaknesses. As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation regarding the acceptance or rejection of the paper.
