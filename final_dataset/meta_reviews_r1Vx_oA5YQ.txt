Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am here to discuss the reviews for the paper titled "Integrated Steganography and Steganalysis with Generative Adversarial Networks". Can you provide me with a summary of the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. We received three reviews for this paper. Review 1 suggests that the paper lacks depth in explaining the suitability of GAN for steganography/steganalysis and provides some suggestions for improvement. Review 2 acknowledges the novelty of the proposed ISS-GAN framework and appreciates the clarity and catchiness of the introduction. However, the reviewer has concerns about the scalability and effectiveness of the framework and the quality of the evaluation results. Review 3 raises questions about the practical application and security of the proposed framework, as well as the clarity of the evaluation protocol.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. It seems like there are some concerns raised by the reviewers. Can you tell me the type of the paper and their confidence levels in their evaluations?

Dialogue agent: The paper is identified as long. Review 1 has a rating of 5, which is marginally below the acceptance threshold, and a confidence level of 5, indicating a high level of certainty in the evaluation. Review 2 has a rating of 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold, and a confidence level of 4. Review 3 has a rating of 5, which is marginally below the acceptance threshold, and a confidence level of 2.

Meta-reviewer: The ratings are quite varied, and it appears that the paper has some strengths and weaknesses. Can you provide more information on the proposed framework?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper proposes an ISS-GAN framework for data hiding in images, which integrates steganography and steganalysis processes in GAN. The discriminative model simulates the steganalysis process, and the steganography generative model generates stego images to confuse the steganalysis discriminative model. The framework embeds interesting ideas and employs PSNR and SSIM metrics to evaluate the approach.

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. Can you tell me whether the reviews suggest accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue agent: While both Review 1 and Review 3 suggest rejecting the paper, Review 2 suggests acceptance with some reservations.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Given the varied ratings and confidence levels, what would be your recommendation for accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not in a position to provide recommendations. I can only provide information on the reviews and their evaluations. It is up to the meta-reviewer to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of the paper and make a decision.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Based on the reviews, it seems that the proposed framework has some potential but also some limitations and concerns. I will consider the reviewer confidence levels, the paper's strengths and weaknesses, and the concerns raised by the reviewers in making my decision. Thank you for your help, dialogue agent.

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. Let me know if you have any more questions.
