Decision maker: Hello, I am interested in the topic of allowing anyone to take a job anywhere. Can you provide me with some arguments for and against this idea?

Dialogue agent: Sure. On the "for" side, it is argued that allowing anyone to take a job anywhere could have economic benefits such as attracting skilled workers and filling labor gaps. As Vivek Wadhwa, a pro-immigration economist, points out - "Probably a slight advantage. Economists are definitely much more pro-immigration than most Americans, but economists also don't like to be extreme. I'm an exception."

Decision maker: Interesting. And what arguments are there against this idea?

Dialogue agent: The "against" arguments revolve around potential negatives like social and cultural disruptions. Ron Unz, for example, has a personal experience that he believes supports the "against" side. He said, "I went to Calcutta at the age of 16, very brave parents. It is an experience that utterly changed my life."

Decision maker: I see. So, based on these arguments, which side do you believe has a stronger case?

Dialogue agent: I'm sorry, but as a neutral dialogue agent, it is not my place to express an opinion or make a decision. My role is to provide information and arguments from both sides of the debate so that you can reach your own conclusion.

Decision maker: Fair enough. Based on what I've heard, I think I lean towards the "for" side, as the economic benefits seem compelling. But I also understand the potential downsides, so I would need to do more research before making a firm decision.

Dialogue agent: That sounds like a rational approach. Remember to consider all perspectives and nuances before coming to a conclusion. Thank you for the discussion!
