Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "ELASTIC: Numerical Reasoning with Adaptive Symbolic Compiler," and I have a few questions for you.

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I am here to answer your questions to the best of my ability.

Meta-reviewer: First, can you tell me about the strengths and weaknesses of the paper as mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Yes, according to Review 1, the paper is technically strong, with novel ideas and excellent evaluations. The design of each component is well described and easy to follow. However, there is a potential weakness in the limited choice of baselines used in the experiments and the lack of a specific section discussing the limitations of the method. Review 2 mentions strengths in the proposed model's novelty and outperformance in the two datasets, but also highlights weaknesses in the lack of clarity in motivation and effectiveness of the separated operator and operand generators. The writing and design of experiments also need improvement. Review 3 mentions strengths in the novelty and value of the proposed method and promising experimental results but also points out the need for improvement in writing and discussions on labeled programs and influence of programming language.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Can you tell me about the confidence levels and ratings assigned to each review?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 has a high rating of 8, indicating a strong accept, with a medium confidence level of 4. Review 2 has a borderline accept rating of 5, with a medium confidence level of 4. Review 3 has a weak accept rating of 6, with a lower confidence level of 3.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you explain to me how the strengths and weaknesses mentioned in the reviews affect the overall assessment of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Of course. The strengths mentioned in the reviews are significant, and the proposed method is novel and shows promising results, which supports the acceptance of the paper. However, the potential weaknesses mentioned in the reviews need to be carefully considered, particularly in terms of the limited choice of baselines used in the experiments, the need for improvement in writing and discussions on labeled programs and the influence of programming language. These could potentially affect the validity and generalizability of the proposed method and could be reasons to reject the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the explanation. How significant is the confidence level in deciding whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: The confidence level is an important factor as it indicates the level of certainty in the reviewer's assessment. A higher confidence level means that the reviewer is more certain of their assessment and could provide stronger arguments to support their rating. However, it is not the only factor to consider, and the strengths and weaknesses mentioned in the reviews should be carefully evaluated.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Based on the reviews, what is your recommendation for the acceptance of the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide recommendations or opinions on the acceptance or rejection of the paper. My role is to provide information and answers to the best of my ability based on the reviews and paper type. The decision to accept or reject the paper ultimately lies with the meta-reviewer based on the reviews and their own assessment.
