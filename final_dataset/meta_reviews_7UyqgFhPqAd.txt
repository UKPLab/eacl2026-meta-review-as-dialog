Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read through the reviews for the paper "Connection- and Node-Sparse Deep Learning: Statistical Guarantees" and I have a few questions.

Dialogue agent: Of course, I am here to answer any questions you may have.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 1 mentioned that the paper provides interesting theoretical results, but it would also be interesting to see some empirical consistency for some of their claims. Can you clarify whether the paper provides any empirical evidence to support their conclusions?

Dialogue agent: As far as I am aware, the paper does not provide any empirical evidence to support their conclusions. The authors acknowledge this limitation and suggest that future work could explore empirical consistency for their claims.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 2 suggested that the paper does not provide much fresh insight into generalization bounds for neural networks and would tend towards rejection. Can you give me more information about why the reviewer felt this way?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 mentioned that the paper makes some overstated claims about the novelty of their results and analysis. The reviewer also suggests that the difference between the regularized and constrained versions of the problem is not significant and that the authors' analysis is almost the same as the usual generalization bounds. Finally, the reviewer suggests that the paper does not provide much fresh insight into generalization bounds for neural networks.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 3 raised concerns about the study of the in-sample prediction error instead of the generalization error. Can you offer any clarification about this issue?

Dialogue agent: The paper does indeed study the in-sample prediction error rather than the generalization error. The authors provide a bound on the in-sample prediction error for a neural network estimator under two types of regularizations, one that induces connection sparsity and another that induces node sparsity. However, as Reviewer 3 mentions, the problem of discovering why over-parametrized neural networks have low generalization error is a crucial problem in deep learning, and the study of the generalization error would provide more valuable insights. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews and your explanations, it seems that the paper has some limitations and drawbacks, but it also provides some interesting theoretical results. Given this, would you say that the paper is above or below the acceptance threshold?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 rated the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold with a confidence level of 3, while Reviewer 3 rated it as marginally below the acceptance threshold with a confidence level of 3. I cannot provide an opinion or a recommendation, but I can tell you that the decision of whether to accept or reject the paper ultimately depends on your assessment of the importance and significance of the results and their limitations.
