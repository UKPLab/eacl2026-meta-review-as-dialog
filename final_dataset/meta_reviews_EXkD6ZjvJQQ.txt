Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have read the reviews for the paper titled "Provable More Data Hurt in High Dimensional Least Squares Estimator." Can you provide me with some additional information?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, what would you like to know?

Meta-reviewer: Can you remind me of the paper type?

Dialogue Agent: The paper is classified as long.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on the reviews, it seems like the paper makes a contribution to the field by providing second-order asymptotic results for different risks using more refined random matrix theory results. However, there were some concerns raised. Can you tell me more about those?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 1 mentioned that the paper's novelty is limited by the use of known results from random matrix theory, which may be seen as an incremental contribution. Additionally, Review 1 stated that Section 4 needs more discussion.

Meta-reviewer: Can you provide any information on the paper's strengths?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 2 noted that the paper's central limit theorem type of results, which provide the convergence speed of the prediction error to its asymptotic limit, are a solid contribution to the field.

Meta-reviewer: And weaknesses?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 expressed a concern that the paper's contribution is limited by the simple setting of isotropic features and signals. Furthermore, Review 2 recommended that the paper's story would be more complete if it extended its results to more recent settings and had lower bound results. 

Meta-reviewer: Very helpful. Lastly, do you have any information on the paper's summary and overall recommendation?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 provided a summary of the paper's contributions to the theoretical understanding of high-dimensional machine learning systems. Review 3 recommended the paper for publication at ICLR, highlighting its solid contributions to the field.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, Dialogue Agent. Based on these reviews, I will need to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in making the final decision.
