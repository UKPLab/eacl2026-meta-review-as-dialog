 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Differentiable Learning-to-Normalize via Switchable Normalization":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Differentiable Learning-to-Normalize via Switchable Normalization". Can you tell me about the paper's main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors propose a method called Switchable Normalization (SN), which learns to switch between different normalization techniques (batch normalization, instance normalization, and layer normalization) based on the task and dataset. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SN on various computer vision tasks.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the reviewer's opinions on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Reviewer 1 finds the paper to be well-motivated and with interesting technical details. Reviewer 2 notes that the proposed method is not significant compared to existing efforts, but the authors demonstrate promising results. Reviewer 3 praises the neat motivation and extensive experiments but notes that there are still some missing results and the joint training of weights could lead to instability.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The paper's strengths include its neat motivation, extensive experiments, and clear illustration. However, the reviews note that some experiment results are missing, and the joint training of weights could lead to instability. Additionally, Reviewer 3 notes that the relationship between the proposed method and previous works could be made clearer.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews, what is your recommendation for accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would recommend accepting the paper with a confidence level of 7, as the authors demonstrate promising results and provide a neat motivation for their approach. However, I would suggest that the authors address the weaknesses noted by the reviewers, such as providing more experiment results and justifying the joint training of weights better.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your summary. I will take your recommendation into consideration when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
