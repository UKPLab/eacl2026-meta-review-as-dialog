Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper titled M$^4$I: Multi-modal Models Membership Inference and I am hoping you can answer a few questions for me.

Dialogue Agent: Of course, Meta-reviewer. I will do my best to provide information based on the reviews and the paper itself.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. First, I would like to ask about Review 1's concern regarding the evaluation of the attack on non-overfit target models. Has the paper considered other scoring methods and evaluated the attack on other multimodal applications?

Dialogue Agent: I am sorry, Meta-reviewer. As a dialogue agent, I am not able to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that the paper only evaluates the attack on image captioning tasks and does not mention other scoring methods or applications.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Thank you for the clarification. Moving on to Review 2's concern about limited technical contributions and the lack of theoretical results to guarantee the discrimination errors. How does the paper address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: The paper does not address these specific concerns directly. However, it does mention the technical contributions of introducing two attack methods for membership inference in multi-modal data and evaluating them under different scenarios and datasets. The paper also presents experimental results that show the advantages of the proposed methods.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Finally, Review 3 expressed strong acceptance of the paper and only provided a suggestion for further explanation of the three evaluation scenarios in the figures. Can you tell me how the paper addresses this suggestion?

Dialogue Agent: The paper does not directly address this suggestion. However, the figures that show the evaluation results for the different scenarios are labeled and explained in the caption below each figure. The paper also provides detailed descriptions of each scenario in the methodology section.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses, Dialogue Agent. Based on the reviews and your information, I am leaning towards a weak acceptance of the paper. However, I am still weighing the importance of reviewer confidence. What is your confidence level in the paper's evaluation and resources?

Dialogue Agent: The confidence level provided in Review 1 is 3, meaning the reviewer is fairly confident in their assessment and may have missed or misunderstood some parts of the submission. Review 3 provides a confidence level of 4, indicating a higher level of confidence but still not absolute certainty. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for reminding me. I will take these confidence levels into consideration. I appreciate your assistance, Dialogue Agent.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, Meta-reviewer. It was my pleasure to assist you.
