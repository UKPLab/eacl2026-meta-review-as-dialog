Decision maker: Hello, I'm interested in learning more about Obama's Iran deal. Can you tell me about the arguments for and against it?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The arguments for the deal suggest that it will prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, and will promote peace and stability in the region. The arguments against the deal suggest that it will allow Iran to continue supporting terrorism, and that it will not prevent them from developing nuclear weapons.

Decision maker: I see. Can you elaborate on the arguments for the deal?

Dialogue agent: One argument for the deal is that it places strict limits on Iran's nuclear program, and subjects them to regular inspections to ensure compliance. This will make it much more difficult for Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Additionally, the deal includes the gradual lifting of economic sanctions, which will promote economic growth and stability in Iran.

For arguments: [['New light, John, I can. After many, many rounds, more than I can remember, of difficult contentious negotiations, I can share with you the insight that people that haven’t slept for five or six days at a stretch get very irritable-- of all nationalities.', 'Just before coming here.']]

Decision maker: And what about the arguments against the deal?

Dialogue agent: One argument against the deal is that it allows Iran to continue supporting terrorist organizations, which could lead to increased violence and instability in the region. Additionally, the lifting of economic sanctions could allow Iran to focus more resources on supporting terrorism rather than on economic development.

Against arguments: [['They’re kissing a lot of frogs. It’s true.', 'Yes.']]

Decision maker: Thank you for the information. So which side do you think presents a stronger argument?

Dialogue agent: As a neutral agent, I cannot express a personal opinion or make a decision. My role is to provide you with the facts and arguments presented by both sides, so that you are better equipped to make an informed decision on the matter.

Decision maker: That's understandable. Thank you for your assistance. I will consider the arguments presented and come to my own conclusion about the deal.
