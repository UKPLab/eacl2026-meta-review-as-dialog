Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your time. I have read through all three reviews, and they seem to be overall positive, with some constructive criticism. How confident are the reviewers in their evaluation?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 has a confidence score of 4, which means that they are confident but not absolutely certain in their evaluation. Reviewer 2 has a confidence score of 3, which is fairly confident. Finally, Reviewer 3 scores 4, indicating they are confident but not absolutely certain in their evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for clarifying. It seems that all reviewers acknowledge the importance of MQBench. However, there are some concerns about the lack of clear instructions or code examples in the paper, which might hinder its use as a benchmark. Can you shed some light on this?

Dialogue agent: Sure. Reviewer 1 emphasized that a good benchmark should be usable by future algorithms and methods, which is not explicitly stated in the paper. They suggest having clear instructions or code examples, which the MQBench publication lacks. Reviewer 2 agrees and points out that the code link provided in the paper does not have any code posted. As for the framework's extensibility, Reviewer 2 also raises concerns about the lack of details provided regarding the framework's input/output/options/system requirements. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. It also appears that Reviewer 3 raises some issues concerning reproducibility. Could you elaborate on that?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Reviewer 3 points out that the paper's biggest weakness is the lack of documented code and a website with a public submission form. Although the methodology is clearly described, and the paper discusses corner cases during training and inference phases of quantized models, without documentation, it cannot be considered reproducible research with a fair evaluation. The reviewers suggest that the main goal of the paper is not fulfilled unless it's clear how to run the code or a submission website is provided.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Despite these shortcomings, all reviewers seem to believe that the paper provides a good comparison of several quantization methods and presents interesting results. Taking into account all the reviews, what should be our final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: Based on the average rating of 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold, the general consensus of the reviewers seems to be positive, with some areas for improvement. Ultimately, the decision whether to accept or reject the paper is up to you. Still, considering the positive aspects highlighted by the reviewers (thorough comparison, interesting results, well-organized paper), an acceptance might be warranted. However, it should be noted that the areas highlighted by the reviewers that require improvement should also be taken into account.
