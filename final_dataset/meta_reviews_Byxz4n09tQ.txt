Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. It seems that Review 1 has some concerns about the motivations and experiments of the paper, while Review 2 acknowledges the interesting aspect of the paper but has some weaknesses to address. Review 3 considers the work to be of high quality but suggests more experiments. Based on these reviews, I have a few questions for the dialogue agent.

Dialogue agent: I'm here to answer your questions. Please go ahead.

Meta-reviewer: Can you provide more clarity on the motivations behind using GAN-generated data for knowledge distillation? Review 1 expressed some concerns about the effectiveness of this method.

Dialogue agent: Our motivation for using GAN-generated data lies in the fact that it can potentially provide a large amount of varied data to assist in training a student network. Due to the nature of the GAN training process, GAN-generated data can be more diverse than real training data, potentially leading to a better generalization of the student network. As for the effectiveness of the method, our experiments have shown that using GAN-generated data does indeed improve the performance of the student network in knowledge distillation tasks.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 also requested some additional experiments to compare with values in Table 1. Can you comment on the importance of these experiments?

Dialogue agent: The experiments requested by Review 1 are certainly important to further validate our method and address some of the concerns raised. Specifically, we can use a mixture of training and GAN-generated data to train the teacher and student network using standard supervised loss without knowledge distillation, and compare the results with the values in Table 1. Additionally, we can evaluate the accuracy of supervised trained teacher and student on GAN-generated images, as well as the classification accuracy on test data by the classifier trained in AC-GAN. These experiments can help further clarify the benefits of GAN-generated data for model compression.

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 raised concerns about the claim that cGAN can generate "infinite" amounts of realistic data. Can you clarify this point?

Dialogue agent: While it is true that the claim of generating "infinite" amounts of realistic data is an exaggeration, our intent was to emphasize that our proposed method can generate a potentially large amount of varied data to assist in model compression. Of course, the quality and diversity of the generated data is ultimately limited by the capacity of the generator network and the training data available.
