Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Universal Stagewise Learning for Non-Convex Problems with Convergence on Averaged Solutions" and I have some questions about the paper before I make a decision on whether to accept or reject it. Can you please tell me more about the paper type?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, the paper is a long type paper.

Meta-reviewer: Great, thank you. I noticed that Review 1 recommended accepting the paper with a rating of 8 and Review 2 and Review 3 both gave a rating of 6. Can you tell me more about the concerns raised by Review 2 and Review 3?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Review 2 mentioned that the concept of weakly-convex optimization considered in the paper is very similar to the bounded non-convexity in the Natasha paper and the authors should clarify their novelty. Review 2 also raised concerns about the convergence rate measurement and the possibility of deriving an upper bound. Review 3 pointed out concerns about the correctness of inequality in function(3), selection of gamma, and the lack of comparison of the convergence rate for other methods.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Can you provide me with more information on the experiments conducted in the paper and the authors' findings?

Dialogue agent: The authors presented an analysis and numerical evaluation of stagewise SGD, ADAGRAD, and Stochastic momentum methods for solving stochastic non-smooth non-convex optimization problems. They added a strongly convex regularizer centered at an iterate of a previous stage to the objective function to build a convex function that can be optimized by any standard methods in the convex optimization setting. The authors developed convergence rates in expectation in terms of the gradient of the envelope. The authors presented two examples showing that popular objective functions in machine learning satisfy the weakly-convex assumption. The numerical evaluation showed the effectiveness of the proposed stagewise algorithms. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. In your opinion, what is the overall confidence level of the reviews?

Dialogue agent: The reviewers are confident but not absolutely certain that their evaluations are correct.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, I see. Based on the reviews and your responses, I will consider the paper carefully and evaluate the importance of Review 1's positive recommendation versus the concerns raised by Review 2 and Review 3. Thank you for your help. 

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. Let me know if you have any further questions.
