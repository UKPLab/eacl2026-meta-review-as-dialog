Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Don't be picky, all students in the right family can learn from good teachers", and I need more information before making a decision. Can you give me a brief overview of the paper and its contributions?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper proposes a method named AutoKD that combines knowledge distillation and architecture generator optimization to search for a family of student network architectures rather than a single architecture. This approach is more sample-efficient, and the authors show that it can achieve competitive performances compared to other knowledge distillation methods on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets.

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me about the strengths of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 states that the paper is clear overall, and the proposed system for combining knowledge distillation and architecture search is promising. They also praise the experimental results on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Review 3 notes that the paper makes it convenient to search for a family of student architectures and that the optimization objective of finding a family instead of a single architecture helps to speed up the process of NAS or be more sample-efficient.

Meta-reviewer: And what about the weaknesses mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 suggests that there is somewhat limited conceptual innovation, and there is little insight into the behavior of the method. They also note that the results are compared with models that use other teacher architectures, making it hard to determine if the improvements are due to an improved teacher or a better knowledge distillation method. Review 2 says that the proposed method is incremental with limited novelty, and they find the experimental results somewhat unconvincing. Similarly, Review 3 mentions that there have already been KD-NAS approaches, and the contribution and novelty of this paper should be reduced accordingly. They also point out that the purpose of some experiments in this paper is a little confusing.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews, what rating would you give to this paper?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 rates the paper marginally below the acceptance threshold with a rating of 5, while Review 2 gives a clear rejection with a rating of 3. Review 3 also gives a clear rejection with a rating of 3. Based on these reviews, the paper has a low chance of acceptance.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Can you tell me your confidence level in these assessments?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 expresses confidence in their evaluation but not absolutely certain, with a confidence level of 4. Review 2 also expresses confidence with a confidence level of 3. Review 3 is confident but not absolutely certain, with a confidence level of 4.
