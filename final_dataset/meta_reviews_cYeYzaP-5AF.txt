 Sure, I'd be happy to help! As a dialogue agent, I will respond to the meta-reviewer's questions based on the information provided in the paper, without expressing any opinions or recommendations.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the opportunity to review this paper. I have some questions about the novelty and impact of the proposed approach. Can you provide some insights?

Me: Of course! The paper proposes a new approach to meta-reinforcement learning called Meta-Optimized Dynamical Synapses (MetODS), which incorporates self-modifying networks to improve the efficiency, capacity, and generality of the algorithm. The proposed approach shows better empirical performance compared to several meta RL baseline algorithms.

Meta-Reviewer: That's interesting. Can you tell me more about the self-modifying networks and how they contribute to the success of MetODS?

Me: Sure! The self-modifying networks in MetODS allow the algorithm to learn relations between stored patterns and incoming information by updating its weights through interaction with the environment and its own current weight state. This mechanism enables MetODS to rapidly compress experience of a task into a particular synaptic configuration, which leads to improved performance.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. However, I have some concerns about the limitations of the experiments and the lack of ablation studies to identify the essential aspects of the approach. Can you address these concerns?

Me: Absolutely! The authors acknowledge the limitations of the experiments and the need for further exploration. They suggest that future work could include running the baselines for longer periods of time to achieve higher performance, as well as incorporating ablation studies to identify the essential components of the approach. Additionally, the authors mention that the proposed algorithm is not limited to a single layer of adaptable weights and could be extended to deeper networks in future work.

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful to know. Can you tell me more about the connection to the policy transport perspective and how it relates to the prior literature?

Me: Sure! The paper connects the proposed approach to the policy transport perspective, which emphasizes the efficiency, capacity, and generality of the algorithm. The authors argue that MetODS achieves better performance in these aspects compared to several meta RL baseline algorithms. However, the discussion of the prior literature seems a little skewed, and the authors could have provided more context and connections to relevant prior ideas.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. I have some other questions, but I think I'll stop here for now.

Me: You're welcome! I'm here to help if you have any further questions.
