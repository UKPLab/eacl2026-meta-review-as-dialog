 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Improving Mammography Malignancy Segmentation by Designing the Training Process":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I am reviewing a paper titled "Improving Mammography Malignancy Segmentation by Designing the Training Process". Can you provide me with a summary of the reviews received so far?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! Based on the reviews received, the paper has been rated 3: Weak Accept with a confidence level of 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct. Review 1 states that the use of self-supervision is interesting and shows some improvement compared to using full supervision. However, the reviewer notes that the evaluation does not include a comparison with existing models on the same public dataset. Review 2 states that the paper is well-motivated, but too many details are missing, making it not possible to understand. Review 3 states that the authors claim 1/8 screening mammograms contain a malignant lesion, which is obviously false, and that the method has too many flaws and lacks context.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, I have some questions. Firstly, can you tell me more about the self-supervised learning approach proposed in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors propose to incorporate unlabelled data with self-supervised learning into the training process to improve segmentation. They use a public dataset for evaluation.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. And what are the reviewer's opinions on the method proposed in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Reviewer 1 finds the use of self-supervision interesting and showing some improvement compared to full supervision. However, Reviewer 2 states that the paper is not possible to understand due to too many missing details. Reviewer 3 has strong reservations about the method, citing several flaws and a lack of context.

Turn 4:
