Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "An Active Learning Framework for Efficient Robust Policy Search" and I want to discuss some points before making my final decision. First of all, can you confirm that the paper is a long type and the reviews are from three different reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Yes, that's correct. The paper is a long type and the reviews are from three different reviewers.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Review 1 seems to be generally positive about the paper but mentions the lack of key references. Does the paper provide enough background information and references to support its claims?

Dialogue agent: As an AI, I am not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, it is mentioned in Review 1 that "there is a huge lack of key references in these topics. It would be better to notice that they were not introduced together with DRL." You may consider this point when making your final decision.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Review 2 raises some concerns about the paper's approach and its presentation. Do you have any comments about these concerns?

Dialogue agent: As an AI, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. Review 2 mentions concerns about the theoretical grounding of the paper, the use of the surrogate model, and the presentation of the experiments. You may take these concerns into account when making your final decision.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 3 also has some major concerns about the proposed framework. Can you summarize these concerns for me?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 expresses major concerns regarding the integration of active learning with policy search and the use of linear stochastic bandits in sampling trajectories. The reviewer questions whether the proposed approach is principled and suggests that a new way of integration or a new objective should be used instead. Additionally, the experiment results are not well presented. You may take these concerns into account when making your final decision.

Meta-reviewer: Alright. Overall, it seems that the reviewers have some concerns about the paper's approach, its supporting references, and the presentation of its experiments. However, there are also some positive aspects mentioned such as the paper's incremental contributions. Given the reviews, I have to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence. Based on the confidence levels given in the reviews, how confident do you think the reviewers are about their evaluations?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 is fairly confident with a confidence level of 3, while Review 2 is also fairly confident with a confidence level of 3. Review 3 is confident but not absolutely certain with a confidence level of 4.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and the concerns raised, I have to say that I am hesitant to accept the paper. However, I will consider the reviewer confidence levels and make my decision accordingly. Thank you for your help, dialogue agent.

Dialogue agent: You're welcome. Let me know if you need any further information.
