 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Behavioral Testing of Knowledge Graph Embedding Models for Link Prediction":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Behavioral Testing of Knowledge Graph Embedding Models for Link Prediction". Can you tell me about the paper's main contributions and findings?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new method for evaluating the performance of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for link prediction, called behavioral testing. The authors identify several limitations in the current evaluation methods and propose a more comprehensive set of capabilities for evaluating KGE models. They also conduct experiments using two important subsets of capabilities and show meaningful insights about the strengths and weaknesses of popular KGE systems.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the proposed behavioral testing method and how it differs from the current evaluation methods?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The proposed behavioral testing method is based on the idea of evaluating KGE models on different capabilities or test types, rather than just averaging the accuracy metrics on all the triples in the test set. The authors identify several important capabilities that should be evaluated, such as symmetry and entity hierarchy. The proposed method is more comprehensive and can reveal more meaningful insights about the performance of KGE models.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the strengths of the proposed method include addressing the limitations of the current evaluation methods, providing a more comprehensive set of capabilities for evaluating KGE models, and revealing meaningful insights about the performance of popular KGE systems. However, one reviewer noted that the proposed method may not be suitable for all KGE models and that further discussion on the limitations of the proposed method is needed.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews, do you think the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions. The reviewers generally agree that the paper addresses an important problem and provides a valuable contribution to the field. However, some reviewers noted that the proposed method may not be suitable for all KGE models and that further discussion on the limitations of the proposed method is needed.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your recommendation. I will take this into consideration when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
