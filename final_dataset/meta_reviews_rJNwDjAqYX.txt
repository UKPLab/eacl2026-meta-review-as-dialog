Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Thank you for joining me today to discuss the reviews of the paper titled "Large-Scale Study of Curiosity-Driven Learning". Can you provide me with a summary of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Of course, Meta-reviewer. In summary, the paper investigates curiosity-driven learning on various tasks and compares several feature space embedding methods. Review 1 expresses some ambiguity about the potential impact of the paper, while also acknowledging the high-quality experiments conducted. Review 2 suggests that the paper could benefit from a systematic experimental comparison with count-based exploration and novelty search. Additionally, it recommends further exploration of the reasons for poor performance of the VAE. Finally, it proposes an interesting area for future work on early stopping techniques. Review 3 also praises the high-quality experiments and clarity of the paper, but recommends a comparison of the performance of curiosity-based learning versus learning based on well-defined extrinsic rewards and exploration of the reasons for the success of random features in the experiments.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews, Dialogue Agent. Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper is well-written and contains high-quality experiments, although there is some ambiguity about the potential impact. Review 2 and Review 3 suggest that additional comparisons and explorations would strengthen the paper. Can you give me more information about the type of paper and the reviews it received?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper is classified as long and received three reviews. Review 1 gave the paper a 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold, and expressed some doubts about the significance of the technical contributions. Review 2 gave the paper a 9, which is in the top 15% of accepted papers, and recommended some additions to strengthen the paper. Review 3 gave the paper a 7, which is a good score, and recommended a comparison of learning based on extrinsic rewards and further exploration of the reasons for the success of random features in the experiments.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information, Dialogue Agent. It seems that the paper has mixed reviews, but has the potential to be improved with additional comparisons and explorations. I will take this into account when making my decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.
