 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "RMSprop converges with proper hyper-parameter":

Turn 1:
Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "RMSprop converges with proper hyper-parameter". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper shows that RMSprop converges with a specific choice of hyperparameters, without assuming bounded gradients. This is important because many previous works on RMSprop assumed bounded gradients, which is not always the case in practice.

Turn 2:
Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the experimental results?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors provide experimental results that support their theoretical findings. They show that RMSprop with the proposed hyperparameters converges to a bounded region in the stochastic setting, and that the method is effective in practice.

Turn 3:
Meta-reviewer: I see. What about the related work section? How does this paper compare to other papers on RMSprop?

Dialogue Agent: The paper compares and contrasts with other works on RMSprop, including Adam and Adagrad. The authors show that their method provides a better understanding of the convergence properties of RMSprop, and that it can be used to improve the performance of the algorithm in practice.

Turn 4:
Meta-reviewer: Okay, I think I have a good understanding of the paper now. Can you tell me more about the theoretical contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper provides a detailed analysis of the convergence properties of RMSprop, including a phase transition from divergence to non-divergence as the hyperparameters are varied. The authors also provide simplified examples to illustrate their results, and show that their method can be applied to a wide range of problems.

Turn 5:
Meta-reviewer: That's great. Can you tell me more about the limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has some limitations, including the fact that the authors assume a specific choice of hyperparameters and that the results may not generalize to all problems. Additionally, the authors note that the method may not be effective in all cases, and that further research is needed to fully understand the convergence properties of RMSprop.

Turn 6:
Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews and my own evaluation, I think the paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold. What do you think?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the paper's contributions, I agree that the paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold. However, I would like to note that the paper has some limitations, and that further research is needed to fully understand the convergence properties of RMSprop.
