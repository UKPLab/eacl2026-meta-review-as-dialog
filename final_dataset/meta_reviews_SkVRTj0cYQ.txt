 Sure! Here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper, "Differentially Private Federated Learning: A Client Level Perspective." The meta-reviewer is aware only of the paper's title and reviews. The dialogue agent responds to the meta-reviewer's questions with summarized answers based on the reviews and without using bullet points.

Meta-reviewer: Hi there! I'm a meta-reviewer for a paper titled "Differentially Private Federated Learning: A Client Level Perspective." Can you help me understand the paper's contributions and novelty compared to previous work?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Based on the reviews, the paper proposes a protocol for training a model over private user data in a federated setting, with a focus on providing privacy for data contributors. The reviews mention that the paper's contributions and novelty compared to previous work are limited, and that the authors could have provided more details on their assumptions about which parties are trusted and which are not.

Meta-reviewer: That helps a bit, but I'm still not sure about the paper's novelty. Can you tell me more about the relationship between this paper and previous work, such as McMahan et al. (2018)?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper builds on previous work by McMahan et al. (2018) and other authors in the field of federated learning. However, the reviews suggest that the paper's contributions may be largely incremental and not significantly different from previous work. The authors could have provided more details on how their approach differs from previous work and why it is important.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the experimental results reported in Section 4 of the paper? The reviews mention that the accuracy of the non-differentially private model is low, but the authors claim that their method provides privacy for data contributors.

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The experimental results reported in Section 4 of the paper show that the proposed method provides a high level of privacy for data contributors, but the accuracy of the non-differentially private model is low. The reviews suggest that the authors could have provided more details on the baseline accuracy of the non-differentially private model and how their method compares to previous work in terms of accuracy and privacy.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help! Based on the reviews, I think the paper has some limitations and could benefit from more details on the authors' assumptions and comparisons to previous work. I will consider these factors when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I hope this information helps you make an informed decision about the paper. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.
