 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Zero-Shot Video Question Answering via Frozen Bidirectional Language Models":

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Zero-Shot Video Question Answering via Frozen Bidirectional Language Models". Can you tell me a little bit about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a method for zero-shot video question answering using frozen bidirectional language models. The authors claim that their method can outperform fine-tuning the entire model and achieve state-of-the-art performance on many zero-shot VideoQA datasets.

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the method proposed in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The method involves using a frozen bidirectional language model as a starting point and fine-tuning only the adapter layers and visual encoder. The authors show that this approach can achieve better performance than fine-tuning the entire model and also reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The main contributions of the paper are the proposal of using frozen bidirectional language models for zero-shot video question answering, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of the method through extensive experiments on multiple datasets. The paper also shows that the proposed method can outperform fine-tuning the entire model and achieve state-of-the-art performance on many zero-shot VideoQA datasets.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, I think I have a good understanding of the paper. What are your thoughts on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The strengths of the paper include its novel approach to zero-shot video question answering, the thorough experimental evaluation, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, the paper does have some limitations, such as the lack of discussion on the negative societal impact of the proposed method and the lack of consideration of other relevant concurrent work.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on your assessment, what would be your recommendation for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on my assessment, I would recommend accepting the paper with a weak accept rating. The paper presents a technically solid and innovative approach to zero-shot video question answering, and the experimental results are convincing. However, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the negative societal impact and consideration of other relevant concurrent work.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. I will take your recommendations into consideration when making my final decision.
