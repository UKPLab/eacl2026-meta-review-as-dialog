Meta-reviewer: Thank you for responding to my request for more information regarding the reviews on the paper "A preconditioned accelerated stochastic gradient descent algorithm". Based on these reviews, I have a few questions for you.

Dialogue agent: Of course, I will do my best to provide you with the necessary information.

Meta-reviewer: Firstly, what can you tell me about the type of paper and the reviews?

Dialogue agent: The paper is categorized as long, and there are three reviews available. Review 1 rates the paper as okay but not good enough, with a confidence level of three out of five, while Review 2 also rates the paper as okay but not good enough, but with a confidence level of five out of five. Review 3 rates the paper as marginally below the acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of three out of five.

Meta-reviewer: What are the main strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method according to the reviews?

Dialogue agent: The proposed method combines Adam-like per-feature adaptation and Nesterov's momentum. Review 1 raises the question of the practical relevance of the method, given that Nesterov's momentum is not widely used in major frameworks. Additionally, Review 1 notes that the experimental section is weak, with insufficient comparison against momentum and an inadequate comparison metric. Meanwhile, Review 2 questions the assumptions made by the authors and the lack of empirical validation beyond the limited scope of the experiments. Finally, Review 3 mentions that the main result and computational context are poorly described, making it difficult for non-experts to understand.

Meta-reviewer: Considering the reviews, do you have any concerns regarding the evaluation of the paper?

Dialogue agent: The evaluations seem to be valid and accurate, but Review 1 raises concerns about the reliability of the experimental results due to unclear details on the grid search and the sensitivity of the proposed method to parameters. Review 2 points out that the empirical evaluations are limited in scope and notes that the conclusions in the paper's conclusion section are too broad. Finally, Review 3 expresses doubts about the method's usefulness given the lack of validation beyond the limited scope of the experiments.

Meta-reviewer: How confident are the reviewers in their evaluations?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 are fairly confident, with a confidence level of three out of five. Reviewer 2 is absolutely certain about their evaluation, with a confidence level of five out of five.
