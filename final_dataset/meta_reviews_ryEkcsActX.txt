 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Teacher Guided Architecture Search":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper titled "Teacher Guided Architecture Search" and I have some questions. Can you help me?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I'll do my best to assist you. What would you like to know?

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: Well, I'm having trouble understanding the proposed method. Can you explain it in simpler terms?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new performance metric for neural architecture search based on the similarity of internal feature representations to a predefined fixed teacher network. The idea is to not only use performance after each epochs as a signal to guide the search procedures, but also to use the similarity of the internal feature representations to the teacher network.

Meta-Reviewer: Ah, I see. But why should a new architecture necessarily mimic the internal representation of the teacher network? Wouldn't the best configuration simply be an exact copy of the teacher network?

Dialogue Agent: That's a good question. The paper addresses this by showing that the proposed method can find architectures that are not simply copies of the teacher network, but rather, architectures that are similar in terms of their internal feature representations.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. But what about the case where the teacher network is not available? This seems to contradict the intention of NAS/AutoML, which aims to automatically find well-performing networks without any human intervention or prior knowledge.

Dialogue Agent: That's a valid concern. The paper acknowledges this limitation and proposes a solution by using a predefined fixed teacher network. However, the authors do not discuss the case where the teacher network is not available.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. And what about the correlation of RDMs in cases where the architecture space is not as structured as in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper shows that the proposed method can be applied to a variety of architecture spaces, including sequential models and cell search spaces. However, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the correlation of RDMs in these cases.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I have one more question. In Figure 1, the middle, the overall correlation of 0.62 is okay, but the correlation for high-performing models, say P+TG > 0.5, is rather small/non-existent. Can you explain why this is the case?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper addresses this by showing that the proposed method can find architectures that are similar in terms of their internal feature representations, but not necessarily identical to the teacher network. This can result in a lower correlation for high-performing models.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help! I have a better understanding of the paper now.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else you would like to know?
