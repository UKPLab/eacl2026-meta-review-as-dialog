Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read through the reviews for the paper "Stackelberg GAN: Towards Provable Minimax Equilibrium via Multi-Generator Architectures" and have some questions for you, the dialogue agent. Firstly, can you provide me with a summary of the paper's contributions?

Dialogue agent: Of course. The paper proposes the Stackelberg GAN framework, which utilizes multiple generators in the GAN architecture. The authors prove that as the number of generators increases, the minimax duality gap shrinks. Additionally, the paper provides a theoretical analysis on the duality gap and presents a way of evaluating it. The authors argue that this approach can be more effective than simply ensembling outputs.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Reviewer 1 mentioned some similarities between Stackelberg GAN and previous multiple-generator GANs, and also raised some concerns about typos and presentation. Can you address these issues?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 pointed out that the algorithm in Stackelberg GAN is simpler than MAD-GAN and MGAN. The authors partially achieved the same goal as these methods by utilizing a simple discriminator loss. However, the reviewer suggests that more comparisons between the three methods are needed, especially on larger datasets. Additionally, Reviewer 1 mentioned numerous typos that should be addressed.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Reviewer 2 seemed to have a positive evaluation of the paper, and believes that the proposed approach can be an effective way of capturing multi-modal sample distributions. Is there anything more you can tell me about Reviewer 2's review?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 agrees with the contribution of the paper in proposing a way of training multi-generators in the GAN architecture. They also found the paper to be well-written and well-organized.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. Lastly, Reviewer 3 raised some concerns about the assumptions made in the Stackelberg GAN framework, and suggested the need for more in-depth analysis. Do you agree with Reviewer 3's concerns?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 3 raised concerns about the assumptions made in the Stackelberg GAN framework, specifically regarding the general finding that more data generating components decreases the duality gap. They suggested that the paper should study the duality gap in the neighborhood of starting solutions, and that the proposed GAN does not necessarily decrease the gap with more components. Reviewer 3 also suggested that the paper should study why multiple data generator components help in practice, and why the proposed model outperforms other GANs in experiments. The dialogue agent does not have an opinion or recommendation in this matter, as we are only tasked with providing information.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on these reviews, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. However, I am concerned with Reviewer 1's confidence level, which was fairly low. Can you provide any additional insights on the reviewers' confidence levels?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 had a fairly low level of confidence, rating the paper as "Marginally below acceptance threshold" with a confidence level of 3. Reviewer 2 had a higher level of confidence, rating the paper as "Good paper, accept" with a confidence level of 3. Reviewer 3 was confident but not absolutely certain, rating the paper as "Ok but not good enough - rejection" with a confidence level of 4.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. I will take all of these factors into consideration when making my final decision on accepting or rejecting the paper.
