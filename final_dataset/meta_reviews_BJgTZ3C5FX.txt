 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Generative model based on minimizing exact empirical Wasserstein distance":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Generative model based on minimizing exact empirical Wasserstein distance". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a generative model based on minimizing the exact empirical Wasserstein distance between real and fake data. This approach has been tried before, but the authors claim to have improved upon existing methods by using a primal version of the Wasserstein loss.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. But I have some concerns about the theoretical limitations of the approach. Can you tell me more about that?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors acknowledge that the empirical Wasserstein estimate requires an exponential number of samples as the number of dimensions increases to reach a certain amount of error. Additionally, the bias of the empirical Wasserstein estimate makes it difficult to differentiate between two batches of the same Gaussian.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. So, what do the authors propose to address these limitations?

Dialogue Agent: The authors suggest using a primal version of the Wasserstein loss, which they claim can help address the theoretical limitations. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the primal version's performance.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I'm not convinced that the paper provides sufficient experimental validation for its claims. Can you tell me more about the experimental setup and results?

Dialogue Agent: The authors evaluate their approach on MNIST and a toy dataset, but the experimental setup is not comprehensive. The authors do not provide enough details about the dataset, the experimental setup, or the results to fully assess the effectiveness of their approach.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I think the paper has some interesting ideas, but the theoretical limitations and insufficient experimental validation are significant concerns. What is your recommendation?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would recommend rejecting the paper. The reviews highlight significant concerns about the theoretical limitations and experimental validation, and the authors do not provide sufficient evidence to address these concerns.

Output:

The meta-reviewer asks the dialogue agent questions about the paper's main contribution, theoretical limitations, and experimental setup. The dialogue agent provides summarized answers based on the reviews, refraining from opinions or recommendations. The meta-reviewer uses the information to make a final decision about accepting or rejecting the paper.
