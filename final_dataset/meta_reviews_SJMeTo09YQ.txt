Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "Guided Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning." Can you provide me with some more information on the reviewers' comments?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, meta-reviewer. What specific information do you need?

Meta-reviewer: Let's start with Review 1. The reviewer seems to be in favor of accepting the paper but has raised some concerns and questions. Can you tell me more about these concerns and whether the authors have addressed them in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 raises several important points, such as the lack of a simple baseline for constraining the action-state space, the relationship with model-based RL, and the overfitting potential of the prediction models. However, the authors have not explicitly addressed these concerns in the paper. They did mention some limitations of their approach, but they could have provided more details on these issues.

Meta-reviewer: That's good to know. What about Review 2? It seems that the reviewer is marginally against accepting the paper. What are the main issues raised by this reviewer?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 states that the paper has some issues related to the number of hyperparameters introduced, the absence of error bars in the presented results, the adhoc method for the creation of the action set, and the narrow application of the proposed techniques. The reviewer also suggests that the authors could have presented more tasks to demonstrate the usefulness of their approach.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what about Review 3? The reviewer seems to be firmly against accepting the paper. What are the main points raised by this reviewer?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 argues that the concept of state-action permissibility (SAP) is too narrow and difficult to define in general. The reviewer questions the application of SAP to other tasks beyond the two simple ones presented in the paper. The reviewer also points out that the user-defined SAP function in the paper eliminates many good solutions and contradicts the philosophy of reinforcement learning.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to reject the paper. However, I am also considering the reviewers' confidence in their evaluations. Could you provide me with the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, meta-reviewer. Review 1 is fairly confident with a rating of 7, while Review 2 is marginally confident with a rating of 5. Review 3 is fairly confident with a rating of 3.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Given that two reviewers are fairly confident and only one is marginally confident, I think we should take their evaluations more seriously. Therefore, I am leaning towards rejecting the paper unless the authors can address the reviewers' concerns satisfactorily.
