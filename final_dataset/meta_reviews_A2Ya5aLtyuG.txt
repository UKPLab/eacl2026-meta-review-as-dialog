Meta-reviewer: Thank you for joining me today. I have read the reviews for the paper "Do Current Multi-Task Optimization Methods in Deep Learning Even Help?" and I have a few questions for you.

Dialogue Agent: Of course, I am here to help answer any questions you may have.

Meta-reviewer: First, can you tell me what type of paper this is?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, this is a long paper.

Meta-reviewer: And what did the reviewers have to say about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: All three reviewers found the paper to be technically solid and providing a comprehensive evaluation of multi-task optimization methods. They thought that the paper had good-to-excellent evaluation resources and reproducibility and had no unaddressed ethical considerations.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds very positive. Were there any concerns raised by the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 1 had two main concerns, one about the organization of Section 4 and the other about the related works not being mentioned. Review 2 had some concerns about the computation cost of the method and whether the same group of hyperparameters is optimal for all different loss weights among tasks. Review 3 had a concern about the limitation section and wanted the authors to clarify the limitation.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, those are valid concerns. Can you summarize the main findings of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper evaluates multi-task optimization methods on three different datasets. The results show that the MTO methods tested did not offer performance improvements over scalarization as a method of optimizing MTL models. The authors also provided a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of hyperparameters and explained why previous MTO methods presented optimistic results. They suggested that investing time in simple and well-tuned baselines may be more beneficial in the long run.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the reviews and your responses, I am inclined to accept this paper. However, I am a bit concerned about the lack of agreement between reviewers in terms of the confidence level of their ratings. For instance, Review 1 gave a rating of 6 with a confidence of 3, while both Review 2 and Review 3 gave a rating of 7 with different confidence levels. Can you help me understand what this means and how I should consider it?

Dialogue Agent: The rating refers to the level of acceptance of the paper. A weak accept (rating 6) means that the paper is technically solid and has moderate-to-high impact, but the confidence level is not as high as it could be. A regular accept (rating 7) means that the paper is technically solid, has high impact, and good-to-excellent evaluation resources and reproducibility. The confidence level indicates how certain the reviewer is about their assessment. Reviewer 1 may have had some uncertainties about their rating, which is why they gave a lower confidence level than the other two reviewers. In general, it is up to the meta-reviewer to weigh the different ratings and confidence levels and make a final decision based on their own judgment.
