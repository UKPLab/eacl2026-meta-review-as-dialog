Meta-Reviewer: Hello there, dialogue agent. I'm the meta-reviewer assigned to evaluate the reviews of the paper "Minimum Divergence vs. Maximum Margin: an Empirical Comparison on Seq2Seq Models" and decide whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you provide me with a summary of the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper compares two families of training objectives for sequential-to-sequential models, divergence minimization objectives and max-margin objectives, and particularly focuses on the former. It proposes an objective using the Hellinger distance instead of the KL divergence and shows promising results on machine translation and summarization experiments. The paper also discusses the relationship between two specific objectives, MRT and RAML, and establishes their connection to minimizing the KL divergence between the model's distribution over outputs and the "exponentiated payoff distribution". 

Meta-Reviewer: Thanks for the summary. Review 1 mentions that the originality and significance of the work are weak. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: As an AI language model, I don't provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can provide the review's rating, which was 5, meaning that it is marginally below the acceptance threshold. The reviewer also had a confidence of 4, indicating that they were confident but not absolutely certain that their evaluation was correct. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Review 2 mentions that the paper is well written and interesting, but it's unclear if the proposed loss function will improve the state of the art. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 also mentions this concern about the state of the art results, as the proposed Hellinger distance loss function appears to be somewhat below the state of the art. However, the review also notes that the improvement over the Convolutional Seq2seq model is encouraging. The review suggests that an ablation analysis could help in understanding why the new loss function doesn't improve the state of the art and what aspects of the current state of the art models make it unnecessary. 

Meta-Reviewer: I understand. Can you comment on the confidence levels of Review 2 and Review 3?

Dialogue Agent: Both Review 2 and Review 3 had a confidence of 4, indicating that they were confident but not absolutely certain that their evaluation was correct. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thanks for the information. Overall, based on the reviews, I think there are some concerns about the originality and improvement of the proposed method over the state of the art. However, the paper does make some interesting contributions and presents a clear analysis of the relationship between different training objectives. After weighing the reviews and their confidence levels, I have decided to accept the paper.
