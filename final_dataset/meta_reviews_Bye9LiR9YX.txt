 Dialogue Agent: Hello! I see you have a paper for me to review. Can you please tell me the title and the type of the paper?

Meta-Reviewer: Sure! The title of the paper is "Remember and Forget for Experience Replay" and it's a long paper.

Dialogue Agent: Great! I'll be happy to help you review the paper. Can you please tell me what you would like to know?

Meta-Reviewer: Well, I have some questions about the novelty of the paper, the clarity of the presentation, and the significance of the results. I would also like to know if the paper provides a thorough examination of on-policy and off-policy learning, and if the authors compare their method to other state-of-the-art techniques.

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I can help you with that. Let me summarize the key points of the paper. The authors introduce two new algorithms, ReF-ER and RACER, which improve the sample efficiency of off-policy reinforcement learning. ReF-ER manages the experience in the replay memory more directly and removes trajectories that follow policies less related to the current parameterized policy. RACER provides a closed-form approximation of the action values, enabling significant gains computationally. The authors provide several empirical studies in benchmark domains showing the competitiveness of their approach.

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the novelty of the paper? I see that the authors mention some related work, but I'm not sure if their method is significantly novel.

Dialogue Agent: Yes, I can address that. The authors mention some related work, such as experience selection and off-policy learning, but their method is significantly novel in that it introduces a new algorithm, ReF-ER, which improves the sample efficiency of off-policy reinforcement learning. Additionally, the authors modify the approximated advantage function in the NAF algorithm to create the RACER algorithm, which provides a closed-form approximation of the action values. These contributions make the paper stand out from previous work in the field.

Meta-Reviewer: That's good to know. What about the clarity of the presentation? Did you find the paper easy to understand?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, I found the paper to be well-written and easy to understand. The authors provide clear explanations of their methods and provide detailed summaries of their results. However, I did notice some minor issues with the presentation, such as the use of undefined symbols in some of the equations.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, that's good to know. What about the significance of the results? Did you find the authors' claims to be supported by their experimental evidence?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, I found the authors' claims to be supported by their experimental evidence. The authors provide several empirical studies in benchmark domains showing the competitiveness of their approach. Additionally, they compare their method to other state-of-the-art techniques and show that it outperforms them in some cases.

Meta-Reviewer: Great! That's all the questions I had. Thank you for your help!

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you. If you have any more questions or need further clarification on any points, please don't hesitate to ask.
