Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Thank you for joining me today. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper titled Kernel RNN Learning (KeRNL). Can you tell me a little bit about the paper type?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper is classified as long.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Now, Reviewer 1 mentions that the results on some of the artificial tasks are mixed or not in favor of BPTT. How important is this concern?

Dialogue Agent: As an AI language model, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but Reviewer 1 suggests that this issue needs to be addressed before increasing their score.

Meta-Reviewer: That's understandable. I also noticed that Reviewer 2 had some detailed comments about the presentation and experimental results. Do you have any insights to offer?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer does acknowledge the surprising performance of KeRNL on several challenging artificial tasks and considers the paper solid. However, they suggest that the presentation needs work, and the experimental results require more explanation. They do provide a rating of 7 and express confidence level 4.

Meta-Reviewer: Interesting. And what can you tell me about Reviewer 3's review of KeRNL?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3 summarizes that KeRNL offers an alternative way of training RNN models compared to the BPTT method and that the kernel function learned is intuitive. They do list some pros and cons of the paper and suggest that the system performance can be further improved. They finally provide a rating of 6 and express confidence level 4.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, I see that there are mixed opinions about KeRNL, with ratings ranging from below to above the acceptance threshold. However, I also see that reviewers acknowledge some novelties and the potential of KeRNL. Based on the confidence levels, which reviewer appears more convinced of their evaluation?

Dialogue Agent: Both Reviewer 2 and Reviewer 3 express a high degree of confidence in their evaluation, with confidence levels of 4.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for confirming that. Based on these reviews and the potential of KeRNL, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I also recognize the issues raised by the reviewers and would like to see the authors address them in the final version before making a final decision. Thank you, Dialogue Agent, for your assistance today.
