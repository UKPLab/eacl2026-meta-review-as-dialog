 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "A Guider Network for Multi-Dual Learning":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there, I'm reviewing a paper titled "A Guider Network for Multi-Dual Learning". Can you help me understand the main contribution of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a guider network that utilizes unlabeled monolingual data as an augmentation to the usual dual learning framework to improve NMT performance. Additionally, a deep Q-learning style scheduling algorithm is proposed to optimize the overall architecture.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. However, I had a hard time following the paper, especially when it comes to the writing. Can you help me understand some of the issues with the writing?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The reviewers mention that the paper needs a major improvement in terms of writing, specifically regarding Figure 1, which is difficult to understand with no explanation in the caption, and the use of too many unnecessary definitions and acronyms. Additionally, there is no objective function or algorithm description provided.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. The reviewers also mention that the paper is hard to follow and that there are some typos and undefined notations. Can you help me understand how the guider network and the dual learning framework work?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The guider network is a novel framework that utilizes unlabeled monolingual data to guide the training of the NMT model. The dual learning framework is an extension of the original framework, which uses both labeled and unlabeled data to train the model. The guider network is used to reconstruct the source sentence from either the output of the encoder or the output of the decoder.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I understand now. However, the reviewers also mention that the experimental results are not convincing and that the models are weak. Can you help me understand why this might be the case?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the reviewers mention that the experimental results are not convincing and that the models are weak. This could be due to several factors, such as the use of weak baselines, the lack of relevant baselines, and the complexity of the training process. Additionally, the paper does not work on standard WMT datasets, which may limit the comparison with other works in the field.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews, I think the paper needs significant improvements in terms of writing and experimental results. I'm going to rate it as "Ok but not good enough - rejection" with a confidence level of 5.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback. I will pass on your comments to the authors and assist them in addressing these issues.
