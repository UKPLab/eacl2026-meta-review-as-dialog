Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent, for joining me to discuss this paper. Let's begin by discussing the strengths and weaknesses that were highlighted in the reviews.

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Review 1 praised the paper for developing a useful extension to the unsupervised behavioral syllable segmentation model space, with an additional latent variable for time warping. The proposed method was validated on synthetic data and applied to analyze mouse behavior data. The paper followed good practices and considered two models to show the contrast between interpretable and flexible models. One of the weaknesses of the paper, as noted by Review 1, is that the method is a relatively small extension of the existing models. However, the addition adds value to both practically and conceptually based on the target application.

Review 2 discussed how the paper provides an extension to the autoregressive Hidden Markov Models (ARHMM), in which the state transitions are modulated by a temporal component that controls the rate of state change. The paper proposed two variants, and the models were applied to two datasets, one synthetic and one real-world dataset. The results showed that the proposed models can infer the hidden state and temporal dynamics. Some of the limitations noted were the unclear choice of hyperparameters and the lack of comparison with state-of-the-art action recognition/segmentation techniques.

Review 3 commended the paper for proposing a new HMM model that can summarize videos of freely moving mice for neuroscience research. The proposed Time-Warped-AHRMM (T-WARHMM) model achieved better log-likelihood values than ARHMM for the same number of discrete hidden states. The estimated warping variable conveys biologically relevant meaning. One limitation noted was that the results were limited to a single non-public real dataset. Another limitation was the lack of a ground-truth annotation to compare the HMM states with human-recognized behaviors.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the reviews, I can see that the paper has many strengths, including its clear presentation, novel extension of HMM models, and valuable application to mouse behavior data. However, there are also some concerns about the paper's drawbacks, such as the lack of hyperparameter tuning and the lack of comparison with state-of-the-art techniques.

Dialogue Agent: Yes, that's correct. Also, please note that Review 3 suggested that a larger set of publicly available datasets would have been more convincing to assess the fit of the proposed method to the particular application, and ground-truth annotations would have been helpful to compare with human-recognized behaviors.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for pointing that out. Overall, I think the paper has shown promising results and has the potential for high impact. Based on the reviews, do you think we should accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 and Review 3 both suggest accepting the paper with a rating of 7. Review 2 suggests accepting the paper with a weak rating of 6. However, all reviewers acknowledge the strengths of the paper and most of the weaknesses. I suggest that we accept the paper based on the reviewers' overall comments and ratings.

Meta-Reviewer: That's a reasonable recommendation. However, since Review 2 highlights some concerns, I would like to ask for your opinion on the technical soundness of the paper as a dialogue agent.

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent that relies on the reviews, I cannot provide my opinion or a recommendation. However, I can say that based on the reviews and my understanding of the paper's contents, the paper seems technically sound with a novel and valuable extension to HMM models, applied to the analysis of mouse behavior data. The method's validation on synthetic data and application to real data also strengthens the credibility of the work.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent, for your assistance in discussing this paper. Based on the overall feedback from the reviewers and your insights, I agree that the paper should be accepted with a rating of 7.
