Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today to discuss the reviews on the paper "Solving NP-Hard Problems on Graphs with Extended AlphaGo Zero."

Dialogue Agent: Of course. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.

Meta-reviewer: Great. First, can you tell me what the paper is about and what type of paper it is?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper proposes an AlphaGo Zero style algorithm for training policies to solve combinatorial optimization problems on graphs. The type of the paper is long.

Meta-reviewer: Thanks. Now, looking at the reviews, it seems like there are some concerns about the paper's contribution and experiments. Can you elaborate on those?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 seems to suggest that the paper's techniques are mostly an off-the-shelf application of AlphaGo Zero and do not provide enough insight beyond empirical advantages in some situations. Review 2 has some concerns about the empirical evaluations of the algorithm and how they could be improved, such as including test-time performance of MCTS with S2V-DQN and wall-clock time comparisons. Review 3 also has some issues with the experimental evaluation, such as missing competitors and timing information.

Meta-reviewer: I see. How confident are the reviewers in their reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct, while Reviewers 2 and 3 are confident but not absolutely certain as well.

Meta-reviewer: Okay. Based on these reviews, do you think the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation. However, I can provide you with information from the reviews and the type of concerns mentioned in them.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. In that case, based on the reviews and the concerns raised, I will have to carefully weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in making my decision. Thank you for your help, dialogue agent.

Dialogue Agent: My pleasure. Let me know if you have any other questions.
