Meta-reviewer: Hi dialogue agent, thank you for joining me today. I have read the reviews for the paper "Hybrid-Regressive Neural Machine Translation" and I would like to discuss them with you before making my decision to accept or reject the paper. Can you tell me about the type of paper and the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The paper is classified as long and the reviews have been provided by three reviewers. Reviewer 1 raised questions on the reliance of small batch size and GPU for computation, and also asked for elaboration on the balanced distribution of deterministic tokens. Reviewer 2 has given a positive feedback and has also pointed out some details regarding the claims made in the paper. Reviewer 3 has mentioned the concerns related to the experiment and comparison of proposed hybrid-regressive translation method.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Can you explain the proposed approach briefly?

Dialogue Agent: The proposed approach combines autoregressive (AT) and non-autoregressive (NAT) paradigms. It first uses an AT model to generate a "gappy" sketch and then fills the gaps with NAT model in a single pass. The AT and NAT models share a majority part of the parameters and can be trained jointly with a carefully designed curriculum learning procedure.

Meta-reviewer: Excellent. Now, can you tell me about the confidence level of the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: The confidence levels range from 4 to 7. For instance, Reviewer 2 has given a rating of 7 and is confident that it is a good paper that should be accepted. However, Reviewer 3 has given a rating of 5 and has some concerns regarding the experiment and comparison of the proposed approach.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. I am particularly intrigued by Reviewer 1's question on the reliance of small batch size and GPU for computation. Can you provide me with an explanation?

Dialogue Agent: The paper investigates that the non-autoregressive decoder (NAT) is more sensitive to batch size and computing devices than the standard auto-regressive decoder (AT). The proposed method aims to alleviate this issue by combining both NAT and AT as hybrid-regressive translation (HRT). The paper does not offer a clear explanation for this observation but it is an interesting point that deserves further investigation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the explanation. Now, looking at the reviews, what is your recommendation for me?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide recommendations or opinions. However, I can provide the information that the paper is rated marginally above the acceptance threshold by Reviewer 1 and marginally below the acceptance threshold by Reviewer 3. Reviewer 2 has given a positive review and has recommended acceptance of the paper. Therefore, it is your decision to weigh the reviews and decide whether to accept or reject the paper.
