Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. Based on your evaluations, it seems there is some confusion regarding the contribution of the paper and the novelty of the proposed method. Can you each clarify your stance and address any concerns you may have?

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for the opportunity to clarify some points. Regarding Review 1, I agree that the proposed "step loss" may not be fundamentally different from some sparse-reward implementations of HER. However, the paper's contribution lies in the removal of any recomputation of the reward function for resampled goals, which the authors claim is a computational improvement. As for the experiments in low-dimensional state space, the authors state in the paper that the proposed method can scale to high-dimensional state space, and future work can investigate this. Regarding Review 2, it seems the reviewer has correctly identified related work that should have been cited. However, the authors claim their method differs from HER in that it requires fewer reward computations, which is supported by their experiments. Finally, in Review 3, the reviewer questions the theoretical justification of the proposed method, but the authors state in the paper that their approach is grounded in a prior work on FWRL, and they provide empirical evidence of its potential usefulness. Additionally, the lack of convincing experimental results may be due to the method not being appropriate for the particular tasks evaluated, rather than a lack of theoretical justification. 

Review 1, based on your evaluation, it seems you are fairly confident in your opinion, and you rate the paper as "Ok but not good enough - rejection". However, the authors do make a claim of computational improvement that should be investigated further, and they propose a new method that differs from some sparse-reward implementations of HER. Would you reconsider your rating, and if not, can you justify your stance further? 

Review 2, based on your evaluation, you rate the paper as "Trivial or wrong", mainly due to concerns regarding the novelty and significance of the proposed method. However, the authors claim their method differs from HER in that it requires fewer reward computations, which they support with experiments. Can you provide further insight into why you still rate the paper as "Trivial or wrong"?

Review 3, based on your evaluation, you rate the paper as "Clear rejection", mainly due to a lack of convincing experimental results and theoretical justification. However, the authors claim their approach is based on prior work on FWRL, and they provide empirical evidence of its potential usefulness. Can you provide further insight into why you still rate the paper as "Clear rejection"?
