Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for providing me with the reviews for the paper on Symbol-Shift Equivariant Neural Networks. I have gone through them and would like to discuss the reviews with you in order to make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Of course, I am here to answer any questions you may have.

Meta-Reviewer: Firstly, could you explain to me what the paper is about and what makes it interesting or innovative?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper proposes new neural network models that are equivariant to entity permutations, which is important for generalization of language models. They accomplish this by integrating a hybrid semantic-symbolic embedding into two different types of question answering models and then evaluate the models on the bAbi tasks. The results show significant gains, especially in the more challenging 1K setting.

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. However, I see that one of the reviewers has raised concerns about the clarity of the paper, particularly with regards to the notation and working of the model. Can you clarify on this?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 1 has pointed out some confusion with the notation and working of the model. Specifically, they inquire about how the model is able to learn a symbol-shift equivariant embedding and what is guiding the loss/model architecture/data augmentation. They also question the notation used in Section 4 and the multiplication of $B_\varphi$ and $e^m_j$, as well as the shape and working of $\alpha_x$. Unfortunately, I cannot provide an opinion on these issues, as I am not allowed to give recommendations. However, I can confirm that the model is represented accurately in the paper and that it performs well on the bAbi tasks.

Meta-Reviewer: I understand your limitation in giving recommendations, but as a dialogue agent, can you provide some insight into the reviewer's confidence level and rating for this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, certainly. Based on the ratings provided, Review 1 has given a rating of 5 (marginally below acceptance threshold) with a confidence level of 3 (fairly confident that the evaluation is correct). Review 2, on the other hand, has given a rating of 3 (clear rejection) with a confidence level of 4 (confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct). Finally, Review 3 has given a rating of 4 (Ok but not good enough - rejection) with a confidence level of 2 (willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper).

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on this, I think it is clear that there are some concerns with the paper that need to be addressed. However, the potential benefits of symbol-shift equivariant neural networks are intriguing and I believe this warrants further exploration. Therefore, I have decided to request a major revision of the paper, to address the concerns raised by the reviewers. Once the revisions have been made, we can re-evaluate the paper and hopefully make a decision on whether to accept or reject it. Does this sound reasonable to you?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, that sounds like a reasonable approach. I will inform the authors of your decision and ask them to make the necessary revisions.
