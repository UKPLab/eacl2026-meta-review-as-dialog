 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "EcoFormer: Energy-Saving Attention with Linear Complexity":

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "EcoFormer: Energy-Saving Attention with Linear Complexity". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new attention mechanism called EcoFormer, which applies kernelized hashing functions to directly map queries and keys into binary codes, reducing the computational complexity using floating-point values. The proposed method achieves similar quality to ordinary multi-headed self-attention (MHSA) with significantly fewer multiplication and addition operations.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the weaknesses of the paper, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to Review 1, the paper does not provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed method, and the authors only report the results on a specific benchmark. Review 2 mentions that the paper does not compare the proposed method with related works using binarization strategies in Transformers, such as BiT. Review 3 highlights some inconsistencies in the matrix sizes in Section 4.2.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the author's responses to these weaknesses?

Dialogue Agent: The authors address the lack of thorough evaluation by mentioning that the proposed method achieves comparable performance with much fewer multiplications and additions on a specific benchmark. They also mention that the paper is well-written and provides a good discussion of the background and related work. However, the authors do not address the comparison with related works using binarization strategies in Transformers.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and your summarized answers, I think the paper has some potential but needs more evaluation and comparison with related works. What is your assessment of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate the paper as "weak accept" with a confidence level of 5. The paper has some novel contributions and is well-written, but the limited evaluation and lack of comparison with related works are concerning. The authors should address these weaknesses in future work.
