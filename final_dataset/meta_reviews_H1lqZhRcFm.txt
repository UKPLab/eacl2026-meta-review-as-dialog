Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read through the reviews for the paper "Unsupervised Learning of the Set of Local Maxima." Can you provide me with some more information on the paper type and the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper is of the type long, and there are three reviews we can discuss.

Meta-reviewer: Great. Let's start with Review 1. This reviewer asks how the authors deal with the different predictions from the trained c and h as an unsupervised method. Can you provide some insight into this?

Dialogue Agent: I am sorry, but as a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can clarify that Review 1 gives a rating of 8, which is considered a clear accept.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What about the confidence level of the reviewer?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 states a confidence level of 3, indicating that the reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct.

Meta-reviewer: Alright, let's move on to Review 2. The reviewer seems to find the paper interesting overall, but suggests that the authors re-think the presentation to make it more approachable. Can you tell me more about the strengths and weaknesses that the reviewer points out?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 gives the paper a rating of 8, indicating a clear accept. The reviewer suggests that the paper has strengths in its novel, multi-agent approach to one-class classification and its extensive evaluation on four problems. However, the theoretical analysis is identified as the weakest part of the paper. The reviewer suggests that the authors consider moving most of the theory to the appendix. Additionally, the reviewer would like to see more discussion on the stability of the proposed system and estimates of error confidence intervals in the experiments.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what about the confidence level of the reviewer in Review 2?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 gives a confidence level of 4, indicating that the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, lastly, let's discuss Review 3. The reviewer seems to have a hard time understanding the paper and suggests that the different terms and concepts are not properly defined. Can you elaborate on what the reviewer is referring to?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Review 3 suggests that the paper lacks a formal problem definition and statement and that the notions and terminologies are not properly defined or introduced. The reviewer is also confused about the optimization problem and the value function mentioned in the paper. However, after the authors provided feedback, the reviewer feels that a lot of things have been clarified, and the paper is interesting in its setting. The review now recommends accepting the paper with improvement suggestions.

Meta-reviewer: I appreciate the insight. Based on these reviews, it seems that the paper is generally well-received, with some areas identified for improvement. I will take these reviews into consideration when making a final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper. Thank you for your help.
