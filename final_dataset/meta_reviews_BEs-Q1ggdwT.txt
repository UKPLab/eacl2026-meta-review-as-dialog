Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper "Policy Gradient with Expected Quadratic Utility Maximization: A New Mean-Variance Approach in Reinforcement Learning." Can you please give me an overview of the reviews that you have received for this paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, of course. We have received three reviews for this paper. Review 1 rated the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold and had some questions regarding the presentation of certain sections of the paper. Review 2 rated the paper as marginally below the acceptance threshold and suggested improvements to the explanations of certain concepts as well as the empirical evaluation. Review 3 recommended rejecting the paper due to incorrect statements and derivations, small contribution, and lack of convincing experiments.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the overview. Can you give me an idea of the type of paper it is?

Dialogue agent: Yes. The type of the paper is long.

Meta-reviewer: Great. Can you please tell me about the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue agent: The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of the Expected Quadratic Utility Maximization (EQUM) framework for policy gradient Mean-Variance control. The paper proposes two algorithms, standard policy gradient and actor-critic, with the EQUM framework. The paper also provides multiple interpretations of the EQUM framework and demonstrates its effectiveness on several risk-sensitive RL benchmarks, such as portfolio optimization.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Can you provide me with more details on the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 liked the paper and found it well-written with ample discussions of state-of-the-art mean-variance RL algorithms. However, the reviewer had some questions regarding certain sections of the paper. Review 2 had mixed feelings about the paper. The reviewer liked the problem motivation, but had some concerns regarding the justification of certain concepts, empirical evaluation, and choice of evaluation domains. Review 3 recommended rejecting the paper due to incorrect statements and derivations, and lack of convincing experiments. The reviewer also had questions regarding the usefulness of the EQUM framework.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that summary. Can you please provide me with the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 had a confidence level of 4, indicating that the reviewer was confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation was correct. Reviewer 2 had a confidence level of 4 as well. Reviewer 3, on the other hand, had a confidence level of 5, indicating that the reviewer was absolutely certain that the evaluation was correct and was very familiar with the relevant literature.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and the confidence levels, how would you rate this paper?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews and confidence levels, I would rate this paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold, with a rating of around 6.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Finally, do you have any suggestions on how I can make a decision on this paper?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper has some issues that need to be addressed, but it also has some strengths. As the meta-reviewer, you should carefully evaluate the importance of the issues raised by the reviewers and weigh them against the strengths of the paper. Additionally, you may also want to consider the confidence levels of the reviewers in making your final decision.
