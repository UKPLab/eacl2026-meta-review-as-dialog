Meta-reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, thank you for joining me today to discuss the reviews for the paper "Class-Aware Adversarial Transformers for Medical Image Segmentation". Can you provide some general information about the paper's type and reviews?

Dialogue agent: Sure, the paper is categorized as long and has received three reviews. Review 1 rates it as a borderline reject, Review 2 rated it as an accept, and Review 3 rated it as a weak accept.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Let's start with Review 1. Can you highlight the strengths and weaknesses mentioned in that review?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 notes that the proposed class-aware transformer module is an interesting aspect of the paper and that the paper is well-written and has careful experimental analysis conducted. However, it also mentions that the novelty and contribution of the paper are limited, the motivation for using an adversarial network is unclear, and the experimental results comparison may be unfair. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what about Review 2? Can you provide a summary of that review?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. Review 2 notes that the proposed generative adversarial transformer called CASTformer for medical image segmentation is interesting and useful. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, and the supplementary materials improve the overall attractiveness of the manuscript. The suggested mechanisms are straightforward but effective and the claims are validated through extensive experiments with significant performance gain.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Moving on to Review 3, can you summarize the reviewer's opinions mentioned in that review?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 states that the proposed Transformer-based segmentation model for medical images called CASTformer is significant due to its use of a multi-scale approach and class-aware transformer module for progressive sampling strategy, as well as the adversarial training scheme and utilization of a pre-trained model from a computer vision dataset. The review notes that the results show an impressive improvement in segmentation performance compared to other algorithms and also mentions some lack of clarity in the paper regarding the use of the term "generative" and the "class-aware" module.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, that was helpful. Considering these reviews, can you recommend whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not authorized to provide my opinion or recommendation. My role is to provide you with the information you need to make the decision.

Meta-reviewer: Right, of course. However, can you tell me about the confidence rating provided by each reviewer?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Review 1 provided a confidence rating of 5, indicating that the reviewer is absolutely certain about their assessment. Review 2 provided a confidence rating of 3, indicating that the reviewer is fairly confident in their assessment but that it's possible they did not understand some parts of the submission or that they are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Review 3 provided a confidence rating of 5, indicating that the reviewer is absolutely certain about their assessment.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that. Confidence ratings are very important when deciding on whether to accept or reject a paper. Based on the reviews and their corresponding confidence ratings, I think I have enough information to make a decision. Thank you, Dialogue agent, for your assistance.

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, Meta-reviewer. I'm glad to have been of help.
