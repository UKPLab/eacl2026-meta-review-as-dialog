Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your reviews of the paper "Toward a realistic model of speech processing in the brain with self-supervised learning." From the reviews, it seems that the paper is technically solid and presents interesting observations. However, there are some weaknesses that need to be considered before making an acceptance decision. Can you provide me with more information about these weaknesses and how they impact the overall evaluation of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. Review 1 points out some limitations and questions regarding the paper. For example, the reviewer notes that the correlations shown in some figures are very low, which may reflect the intrinsic SNR limitations of the fMRI signal. Additionally, the reviewer suggests that some of the claims regarding the selectivity of different brain regions for speech vs. non-speech information may be based on extremely small differences and be hard to interpret. Review 1 also notes that some of the results may not be too surprising given prior expectations and earlier literature. These limitations and questions should be taken into account when making an acceptance decision.

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. Review 2 also notes some weaknesses, including the lack of novelty and significant analysis, and overstatements and claims made in the paper. Additionally, Review 2 suggests that the authors missed some relevant citations. Does that accurately summarize the concerns?

Dialogue agent: Yes, that's correct. Review 2 highlights the identical results and analyses in prior work on supervised models and concurrent work on self-supervised models, which raises questions about the novelty of this work. Additionally, Review 2 points out that some of the claims made in the paper are overstated and may not be well-supported by the evidence presented. Finally, Review 2 notes that some relevant citations were missed in the paper.

Meta-reviewer: That gives me a good sense of the weaknesses that need to be considered. Review 3 indicates that there are no major limitations or innovations, but the paper presents interesting observations with no unaddressed ethical considerations. Based on all of the reviews, it seems that the paper is borderline for acceptance. Is there anything else I should know before making a decision?

Dialogue agent: The paper is classified as a long paper and has a rating of 6 from Review 1 and a rating of 7 from Review 3, indicating that it is technically solid and has moderate-to-high impact. However, Review 2 rates the paper as borderline accept, primarily due to the lack of novelty and significant analysis, and overstated claims. Additionally, the confidence level for Review 3 is low, indicating that the reviewer may not be fully familiar with the related work and the details of the paper. All of these factors should be taken into account when making an acceptance decision.
