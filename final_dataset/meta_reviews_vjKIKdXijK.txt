 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Convexity Certificates from Hessians":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Convexity Certificates from Hessians". Can you tell me what this paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper presents an implementation of the Hessian approach for certifying the convexity of differential functions. It complements the well-established disciplined convex programming (DCP) approach and works for non-differentiable functions.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has several strengths. First, the writing is very good and the presentation is clear. Second, the implementation is based on a formal language that is sufficiently rich to support a large class of problems. Finally, the fundamentals of the implementation seem to be solid by using computational graphs for Hessians, the rule set, and atoms.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me about the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. One weakness is the lack of formalism. While the authors provide examples, there is no pseudo-code shared to understand the mechanisms of the approach and help peers to build upon it. Additionally, there are a few definitions that are simply not defined or understandable as detailed in the questions.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: How do you rate this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate this paper as a strong accept. The paper has novel ideas, excellent impact on at least one area, and excellent evaluation, resources, and reproducibility.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: What is your confidence level in your assessment?

Dialogue Agent: My confidence level is 5, as I am absolutely certain about my assessment. I am very familiar with the related work and checked the math/other details carefully.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on your assessment, I will make my final decision about accepting or rejecting the paper.
