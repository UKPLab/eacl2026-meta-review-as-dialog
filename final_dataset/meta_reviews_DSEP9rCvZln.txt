 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Inherently Explainable Reinforcement Learning in Natural Language":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi there, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Inherently Explainable Reinforcement Learning in Natural Language". Can you tell me a bit about the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper addresses the problem of generating intermediate natural language explanations for sequential decision making in IF games. The approach is based on a RL framework which uses a knowledge graph special for IF games as state representation, combined with several attention mechanisms. The paper provides evidence that temporally-extended explanations deliver value for generating explanations.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main concerns and limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: One of the main concerns is the generation of temporally-extended explanations, which consists of a cascade of different components. The paper provides an ablation study to assess the importance of relevant game steps to form a temporally-extended explanation. However, the reviewer would like to see more general solutions to assess the importance of relevant game steps. Additionally, the paper's novelty is limited, as the ideas used for immediate explanation and trajectory-level explanation are not entirely new.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: I see. What is your rating and confidence level for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the strengths and limitations of the paper, I would rate it a 4 on the borderline reject scale. I am fairly confident in my assessment, but there is a possibility that I may have not understood some parts of the submission or be unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. I will consider your feedback in my decision. Can you tell me more about the related work in the field of reinforcement learning and natural language processing?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper mentions related work in text games that have been pursued, such as continual learning [1], action pruning [2], and many others. The authors also mention the work of Xu et al. [3] which uses a similar approach for immediate explanation, and Ammanabrolu et al. [4] which provides a similar approach for trajectory-level explanation. However, the novelty of the paper is limited as it combines two existing papers [Xu et al. + Ammanabrolu et al.].

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. I will now make my decision based on the feedback from the dialogue agent.
