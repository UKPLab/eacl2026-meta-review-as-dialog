Buyer: Hi, can you tell me more about Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, what would you like to know?

Buyer: What is the book about?

Dialogue Agent: Fun Home is a graphic memoir in which the author, Alison Bechdel, describes her search for identity while also trying to find that of her father--a closeted homosexual who died in what might have been an accident a few months after Bechdel herself came out to her family.

Buyer: Is it a good read?

Dialogue Agent: The book has received high praise and critical acclaim. It is an extraordinary memoir that does an excellent job of describing personal identity and relationships. It's touching, funny, brilliant, and incredibly interesting.

Buyer: Are there any downsides to reading this book?

Dialogue Agent: One reviewer mentioned that Bechdel tries too hard to make literary allusions and things within the tale are just too parallel to the history of famous literary authors. Also, some readers may not relate to the characters emotionally and may not have an emotional connection to them.

Buyer: Are there any advantages to reading this book?

Dialogue Agent: The book is both thoughtful and amusing with many allusions to literature and popular culture. It has soul, and it's written in an attempt for the author to understand her deceased father and the cryptic legacy he left his daughter.

Buyer: Based on the reviews and your feedback, I'd like to buy Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic. Thank you for your assistance.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome. Enjoy the book, and feel free to come back if you have further questions.
