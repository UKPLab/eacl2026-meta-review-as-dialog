 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:
Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Why Do Neural Response Generation Models Prefer Universal Replies?" and I have some questions about the reviews.

Dialogue Agent: Hello! I'd be happy to help you with your questions. Please go ahead and ask away.

Turn 2:
Meta-reviewer: Okay, so the first review states that the paper investigates the problem of universal replies plaguing the Seq2Seq neural generation models, but the author's approach yields better results in the dataset considered using various measures and human evaluation. What do you think of this review?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the review, the author's approach seems to have improved the results in the dataset considered using various measures and human evaluation. However, I cannot provide a definitive assessment without knowing more about the specific approach and results.

Turn 3:
Meta-reviewer: The second review states that the paper looks into improving the neural response generation task by deemphasizing the common responses using modification of the loss function and presentation the common/universal responses during the training phase. The reviewer provides some improvement points and states that the evaluation is correct. What are your thoughts on this review?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the review, the author's approach of deemphasizing common responses and presenting common/universal responses during training seems to have improved the results in the dataset considered. The reviewer provides some improvement points, but I cannot provide a definitive assessment without knowing more about the specific approach and results.

Turn 4:
Meta-reviewer: The third review states that the paper presents a framework for understanding why seq2seq neural response generators prefer "universal"/generic replies, but the results presented in the paper are not technically sound. The reviewer provides some specific examples of issues with the paper's technical content. What do you think of this review?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the review, the paper seems to have some technical issues with its derivations and assumptions. The reviewer provides specific examples of issues with the paper's technical content, which may impact the validity and reliability of the results.

Turn 5:
Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews, I'm considering the paper's technical soundness, the validity of the results, and the potential impact of the paper on the field. What are your thoughts on these factors?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper seems to have some technical issues with its derivations and assumptions, which may impact the validity and reliability of the results. Additionally, the paper's approach of deemphasizing common responses and presenting common/universal responses during training seems to have improved the results in the dataset considered. However, without knowing more about the specific approach and results, I cannot provide a definitive assessment of the paper's potential impact on the field.
