 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper about candidate generation for medical concept linking. The title is "Discriminative Candidate Generation for Medical Concept Linking". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a weighted combination of different candidate generating features, such as exact string match, BM25, character 4-grams, or abbreviation matches, to improve the accuracy of candidate generation for medical concept linking.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. But I'm not sure if the paper adequately addresses the issue of computational efficiency. Can you tell me more about that?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper does discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed method. The authors note that the proposed method is computationally efficient and can be used in real-world applications. However, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison of the computational efficiency of the proposed method with other existing methods.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: That's a good point. I also have some concerns about the evaluation methodology used in the paper. Can you tell me more about that?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The paper evaluates the proposed method using the Share/CLEF eHealth task. The authors provide an exhaustive evaluation of different properties of the candidate set, such as MRR and coverage. However, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the effects of the candidate set on the final result when combined with a candidate-based entity linker.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on my knowledge of the relevant literature, I think the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison of the proposed method with other existing methods. Can you tell me more about the related work in the field?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper mentions related work in the field of entity linking, including the use of pairwise comparison models and the importance of candidate generation. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the related work or compare the proposed method with other existing methods.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on my evaluation, I would rate the paper as marginally below the acceptance threshold. The authors make a valid point about the importance of candidate generation, but the paper could benefit from a more detailed comparison of the proposed method with other existing methods and a more exhaustive evaluation of the effects of the candidate set on the final result.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback. I will pass on your comments to the authors. Is there anything else you would like to know or discuss?
