 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper called "Talk the Walk: Navigating Grids in New York City through Grounded Dialogue". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper introduces a new task called "Talk the Walk", where a tourist and a guide have to communicate in natural language to reach a common goal. It also introduces strong baselines for the task.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the reviewers saying about this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the reviewers have mixed opinions about the paper. Reviewer 1 thinks the paper is marginally above the acceptance threshold, while Reviewer 2 thinks it's a good paper and should be accepted. Reviewer 3 has some concerns about the task being too hard and the model's NLU/NLG system being weak.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the paper based on the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: The paper's strengths include its thorough and clear descriptions, the introduction of a new task, and the strong baselines for the task. However, the reviewers have some concerns about the task being too hard, the model's NLU/NLG system being weak, and the lack of examples in the discussion of the experimental tasks.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. What are your thoughts on the paper's acceptance?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would say that the paper is marginaly above the acceptance threshold. However, the reviewers have some concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be accepted.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Do you have any suggestions for how the authors could address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors could provide more examples in the discussion of the experimental tasks to demonstrate the challenges of the task and how the model addresses them. Additionally, they could address the concerns about the model's NLU/NLG system by providing more analysis and justification for their approach.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. I will consider your suggestions when making my decision about the paper's acceptance.
