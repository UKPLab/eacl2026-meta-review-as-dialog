Meta-Reviewer: Hello, can you tell me your thoughts on the paper's reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, I can provide you with an overview of the reviews, but I cannot provide opinions or recommendations as per my programming. Review 1 discusses the paper's approach to distributed learning with random Fourier features. The review points out the paper's main contribution, which is a consistency bound. However, the reviewer disagrees with the considered distributed setting and believes that the algorithm's improvement over varying amounts to linear computational complexity is not significant enough. Review 2 discusses the statistical properties of distributed kernel ridge regression with random features and communications. The review suggests that the paper's algorithm and derived results are new and interesting, but the presentation and citations require major revisions. Review 3 discusses the paper's analysis of generalization properties in distributed kernel ridge regression with random features and communication. The review thinks that the improvements are essential for the associated community but mentions that some adaptation from previous work could have been better credited.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, do you think the paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue Agent: As per the reviews, Review 1 has rated the paper 4, which according to their rating scale is "Okay but not good enough - rejection." Both Review 2 and Review 3 have rated the paper 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold. Therefore, based on these reviews, it is difficult to determine whether the paper should be accepted or rejected. It would be best to weigh the reviewer's comments objectively and make a judgment based on the paper's content and contribution. 

Meta-Reviewer: That's fair. Based on reviewer confidence, which review do you think should be given more weight in our decision?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviewer confidence ratings provided, Review 1 and Review 2 have a confidence rating of 4 and 3, respectively, indicating that they are confident but not absolutely certain that their evaluation is correct. Review 3 has a confidence rating of 3, which is similar to Review 2. Therefore, I suggest that all reviews should be taken into consideration, and their comments and criticisms evaluated objectively in making the final decision.
