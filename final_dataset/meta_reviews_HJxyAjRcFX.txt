Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have gone through the reviews of the paper titled "Harmonizing Maximum Likelihood with GANs for Multimodal Conditional Generation", and I have a few questions before making my final decision.

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I'll do my best to answer your questions without providing any opinions or recommendations.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 seems to be very positive about the paper, mentioning that it's solving an important problem. However, they have a couple of suggestions for the authors. What do you think about those suggestions?

Dialogue agent: Review 1's suggestions seem reasonable and worth considering. The authors may want to explore the effects of not using the GAN loss and training only with the MLMM or MCMLE losses. Additionally, they may want to comment on the potential shortcomings of using a simple un-correlated Gaussian to model the sample distributions.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Review 2 seems to have some questions about the experiments. Can you elaborate on that, please?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 has questions about how changing the reconstruction loss affects the training process and whether MLMM_1 can be compared with other methods on SRGAN-celebA and GLCIC-A. The review also suggests that the usage of Gaussian MLMM_1 makes more sense than MLMM_{1/2}, as demonstrated in the pix2pix cases.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Review 3 mentions that the paper lacks novelty, and the theoretical results seem weak. What is your take on that?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 points out that while the paper proposes an interesting modification to the traditional conditional GAN objective, the core idea lacks novelty. The review also mentions that the theoretical results are weak and do not support the proposition very well.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. After going through all the reviews and your responses, I think I have enough information to make a decision. Thank you for your help.

Dialogue agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. I'll be here if you have any more questions.
