 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper called "Cost-Sensitive Self-Training for Optimizing Non-Decomposable Metrics". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new technique for optimizing non-decomposable metrics in self-supervised learning settings. The method is based on a hybrid loss for optimizing non-decomposable metrics in supervised learning settings.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the theoretical justifications for the proposed models?

Dialogue Agent: The authors provide theoretical justifications for the proposed models in Section 3 of the paper. They show that the proposed method leads to a lower error compared to standard optimization over the loss.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the technical contribution of the paper? Can you summarize the main points?

Dialogue Agent: The paper combines a theoretical analysis with some strong empirical results compared to existing baselines. It proposes a new loss function and a thresholding approach for self-training, which improves the performance for the task at hand.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. I have some concerns about the clarity of the paper and the assumption made in the theoretical part. Can you address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: The authors have added more explanation in the appendix to address the clarity concerns. Regarding the assumptions, the authors have made them explicit and justified them in the paper. However, the reviewers may have different opinions on this matter.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews, I think the paper is technically solid, but the clarity of the paper is a concern. I'm leaning towards rejecting the paper, but I'm open to hearing more from the authors. What do you think?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper has both strengths and weaknesses. The authors have provided a novel technique for optimizing non-decomposable metrics, but the clarity of the paper is a concern. However, the reviewers have provided constructive feedback, which can help the authors improve the paper.
