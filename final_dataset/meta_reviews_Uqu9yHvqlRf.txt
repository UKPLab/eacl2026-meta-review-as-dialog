 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper. The title of the paper is "What Preserves the Emergence of Language?". The type of the paper is long. The reviews are [Review 1: **Summary:** This paper studies multi-agent communication with an aim to mimic conditions for the emergence of language in society. They argue that the emergence of language requires co-operation. However, people can cheat and make a profit by lying, and eventually, people have no incentive to co-operate. A proxy multi-agent setting is created to study this which proceeds in a series of interactions between two (randomly sampled) agents. In each interaction, there is a market demand for N items, and both agents have a fixed quantity of these items and their own hidden utility. An agent makes a proposal to another agent for a set of goods which consists of quantities of each item that they are willing to give. The other agent has to fulfill the remaining quantity to match the market demand. The other agent can accept the proposal at which point both agents get reward based on the remaining items and their respective utilities. Otherwise, the bargaining will continue and the other agent will make a proposal. There is a timeout after which both get a reward of 0. **Strengths:** - The setting is interesting. In general, understanding the dynamics of language evolution is a very interesting topic. This can shed light on human history, and maybe potentially be helpful for developing language understanding agents. **Weaknesses:** - The language part of the story is confusing since there is no language used in the experiments. In fact, what is really being asked here is if we can have a society without cooperation? Since, if everyone ends up being a liar then we don't have a society. Therefore, the language part feels like a red-herring. - Implications of the results are unclear as it is not obvious that the setup captures all the important nuances present in human society. E.g., in a real-world, people who are speaking the truth can help each other by sharing technology that can give them a survivor edge over liars. This happens even if liars are not directly punished for their deeds. Then there is the question if the way natural selection and genetic evolution are modeled, reflect the real-world. I am not an expert on evolution but the paper doesn't say enough to justify the choice. **Questions:** - In the case where agent "i" lies, the other agent will still end up paying its share of the accepted proposal plus 50% of what agent "i" promised. Is this right? - Can one pay more items than they possess? If not, do we always have $d_n \ge q^i_n + q^j_n$ for every $i$ and $j$, as otherwise there are not enough items to satisfy the market? - In the setting of individual resistance, once an agent ends up with a negative credit score then the truth-tellers will refuse to play with them resulting in an addition of $1 - \sqrt{e} < 0$ to their credit score. So can an agent never increase their total reward once their credit score becomes negative? Or, perhaps liars will still play with them and so there is a chance for their total reward to increase. - How would the behavior be if the agent also had access to (i) total reward earned by the other agent, (ii) percentage of cases the other agent lied? E.g., if an agent saw that the other agent lie then they are likely to either not play with them or demand a more lucrative offer before committing. This can allow for more interesting policies to evolve.], [Review 2: # Overall review This paper attempts to address a question in the emergent communication literature: what preserves / maintains the stability of emerged communication protocols. The authors manipulate the prevalence of lying behavior in a community of agents playing a variant of a Nash bargaining game. The main take-away is that explicit punishment, from the environment and from truth-tellers not wanting to communicate with liars, can prevent the spread of exploitative lying behavior in the community. My main worry about the paper is that the conceptual motivation is a bit unclear. The authors present the paper as addressing when emergent communication can be stable. And, after identifying a condition under which a penalty for lying removes liars from the population, they conclude that "Only under such a environment, language is finally possible." But in all experiments, the communication protocol is fixed: mappings from market needs to proposals. In other words, what changes is less the communication protocol itself, and more the prevalence of lying / truth-telling. It thus is not clear how these results are to be interpreted as being about the emergence of communication itself, and not alternative uses of a pre-existing protocol. Pros: Addresses a foundational question in emergent communication. Explicitly models a community of agents, instead of just dyads. Identifies explicit factors influencing their outcome of interest. Cons: The conceptual motivation is a bit unclear. Communication protocol is fixed, not emergent. Many interesting results / sub-experiments are presented as parentheticals / foot-notes, without full details in appendices. # Small comments. p 3, choice to not do simultaneous proposals. More details about these experiments should probably be provided in an appendix. p 8, "artificial intelligent" should be "artificial intelligence".]
