DM: Good evening. I’m here to learn more about the debate’s topic that "Russia is becoming our enemy again". Can you please provide me with more information on this?

DA: Certainly. The argument for the motion is that under the increasingly authoritarian leadership of President Putin, Russia is becoming more hostile towards the United States. Its actions in the Middle East, for example, go against US interests.

DA: On the other hand, the argument against the motion is that while Russia is not a US ally, it is also not an enemy. Russia is seeking an independent role in international politics and wants its national interests respected, not just those defined by the US. Its stance on certain issues such as NATO initiatives and US foreign policy is a challenge, but this doesn't make it an enemy.

DM: Can you elaborate more on the actions by Russia in the Middle East?

DA: The argument is that Russia has every interest in keeping oil prices high and making trouble in the Middle East, which goes against US interests. This, in turn, could be seen as a hostile or opposing action towards the US.

DM: I see. And what evidence is there to support the argument that Russia is becoming our enemy again?

DA: The argument for the motion points to President Putin's increasingly centralized and authoritarian centers of power, as well as the fact that anti-Americanism within Russia is more intense and widespread than it has been in the past. There are concerns about Russia's direction and its trajectory towards becoming an enemy, rather than its current status as a non-ally.

DM: And what evidence is there to support the argument against the motion?

DA: The argument against the motion notes that Russia wants a voice at the table with major powers, respect for its national interests, and an independent role in international politics. While its stance on certain issues may challenge the US, this does not necessarily make it an enemy. Furthermore, the absence of a strategic vision in Putin's leadership makes it difficult for Russia to make long-term strategic choices.

DM: Thank you for the information. Based on what you’ve said, it seems like the matter is complex and there are valid arguments on both sides. Is there anything else that you think could help me reach a conclusion?

DA: It's important to note that while there may be disagreements and challenges between the US and Russia, it is crucial to pursue a policy that is frank, firm, and constructive. Engaging in dialogue and finding common ground on shared interests can help mitigate tensions and overcome differences. It's also important to coordinate with other major countries in the West, Europe, and Japan to ensure a coherent approach to Russia.
