 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "SelecMix: Debiased Learning by Contradicting-pair Sampling":

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "SelecMix: Debiased Learning by Contradicting-pair Sampling". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors propose a method called SelecMix, which uses contradicting-pair sampling to debias the learning process. Specifically, they select pairs of input samples with the same label but different bias attributes, and pairs with different labels but similar bias attributes, and mix them up to train a model.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the paper has several strengths. One strength is that the authors provide a comprehensive set of experiments and analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method. Another strength is that the method is effective in improving the robustness of the model on various datasets. Additionally, the authors provide a solid set of ablation studies to further support their findings.

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me about the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. One weakness of the paper is that the organization of the paper is not very easy to follow. Additionally, the core contribution of the paper is SelectMix, but the authors also include a contrastive objective in training, which is not fully analyzed in the paper. Finally, some reviewers have noted that the paper has limited evaluation and does not fully address societal impact.

Meta-reviewer: How do the reviewers rate the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper receives a rating of 4: Borderline reject. The reviewers are not absolutely certain about the assessment, but the paper does not meet all the criteria for acceptance.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and your summary, I will make my final decision.
