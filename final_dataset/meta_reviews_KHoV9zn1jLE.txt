Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper "Implicitly regularized interaction between SGD and the loss landscape geometry". Can you provide me with some information about the reviews for this paper?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, meta-reviewer. There are three reviews for this paper. Review 1 praises the original idea of interaction-aware sharpness while highlighting some weaknesses, such as a weak connection to generalization and a lack of theoretical support for the proposed learning rate scaling. Review 2, on the other hand, criticizes the paper for being poorly written and states that the claims are not convincing enough. Review 3 acknowledges the contributions of the paper but also lists some weaknesses, such as the lack of generalization to momentum gradient descent and the undefined scaling rule.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, what is your recommendation for acceptance or rejection of the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide recommendations or opinions. However, I can inform you that Review 1 gave a rating of 3 and recommended rejection, while Review 2 gave a rating of 3 and also recommended rejection. Review 3, on the other hand, gave a rating of 7 and recommended acceptance.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you provide me with more information on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper based on the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 mentions the originality of the idea of interaction-aware sharpness and the empirical evidence provided to support it. However, they also list weaknesses such as a lack of theoretical support for the proposed learning rate scaling and a weak connection to generalization. Review 2 criticizes the paper for being poorly written and having claims that are not convincing enough. Review 3 acknowledges the contributions of the paper but mentions weaknesses such as the lack of generalization to momentum gradient descent and the undefined scaling rule.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Thank you for the detailed information. Based on these reviews, I see that there are both strengths and weaknesses to the paper. However, I am particularly concerned about the lack of theoretical support for the proposed learning rate scaling and the poorly written nature of the paper. Therefore, I am inclined to reject the paper. However, I am curious about the high rating and recommendation for acceptance given by Review 3. Can you provide me with more information on their reasoning?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 acknowledges the contributions of the paper in proposing a new characterization of the edge of stability (EoS) for SGD dynamics, investigating the behavior of gradient descent at the EoS, and proposing a new scaling rule for the linear rate. They state that these experiments will be useful for people interested in how gradient descent manages to remain semi-stable at the EoS. However, they also mention weaknesses in the lack of generalization to momentum gradient descent and the undefined scaling rule. Ultimately, they gave a rating of 7 and recommend acceptance based on the technical solidity and potential impact of the paper.

Meta-reviewer: I see. While I appreciate Review 3's positive assessment of the paper, I remain concerned about the lack of theoretical support and the poorly written nature of the paper. Therefore, I will go ahead and reject the paper based on the feedback from Reviews 1 and 2. Thank you for the information.
