Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have some questions about the paper titled "Measuring Density and Similarity of Task Relevant Information in Neural Representations". Can you provide some insights into the reviews it has received?

Dialogue agent: Of course, meta-reviewer. What would you like me to address?

Meta-reviewer: My first question is regarding Review 1's criticisms about the methodology and missing analysis. Can you give me some more information about that?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 had concerns about the methodology used to compute the classification feature selection (CFS) and its susceptibility to rotations of the representations. The reviewer also noted that there were no experiments or analysis conducted to show how stable the results were across different runs of the representation technique. Additionally, the reviewer suggested that more baselines for transfer learning should be explored, including ones that are zero-cost.

Meta-reviewer: That is quite helpful, thank you. Moving on, can you provide me with insights into Review 2's comments about the paper's notion of similarity through classifier weights and its limited scope of application?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 commented on the paper's use of a metric for information transfer based on the difference in classifier weights between two tasks. The reviewer questioned whether this metric was well-defined, and whether classifier weights could come out quite different despite the tasks being similar. As for the scope of application, the reviewer noted that the paper seems to focus exclusively on classification tasks, and that it would be useful to explore how the proposed metrics could be applied outside of this context.

Meta-reviewer: Finally, can you elaborate on Review 3's critique of the practical utility of the metrics proposed in the paper?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 had concerns about the practical utility of the proposed metrics for measuring information density in learned representations, noting that they require supervision in the target domain. The reviewer expressed skepticism that this would be a real practical issue, and suggested that exploring multiple encoder architectures would be more compelling. Additionally, the reviewer noted that the CFS metric depends on an arbitrary hyperparameter, and that the motivation for restricting the analysis to linear models was unclear. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your detailed responses. Considering these reviews and their confidence ratings, what is your overall assessment of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 rated the paper as "Ok but not good enough - rejection" with a confidence rating of 4, Review 2 rated it as "Marginally below acceptance threshold" with a confidence rating of 4, and Review 3 also rated it as "Marginally below acceptance threshold" but with a confidence rating of 3. Based on these reviews, it seems that the paper has some promising aspects but also has some weaknesses and limitations. As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but can only present the reviews and their confidence ratings to you for consideration.
