Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Can you tell me about the reviews of the paper titled "Language Modeling with Graph Temporal Convolutional Networks"?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. There are three reviews available for this paper.

Meta-reviewer: Can you please summarize the main points of each review?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 praises the idea of treating language as structured and finds the intuition of the proposed model reasonable. However, the reviewer also points out several cons, including the need for improved writing and missing discussions on existing works.

Review 2 also finds the proposed model interesting, but the reviewer highlights several cons, including the need for more experimentation and comparisons to other models.

Review 3 compliments the clarity of the paper but criticizes the evaluation done on a small and outdated dataset like Penn Treebank.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Can you tell me about any common issues that were raised in all the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, certain common issues raised in all the reviews include the need for better comparisons to existing works, more experiments and evaluations on larger datasets, and improved writing.

Meta-reviewer: Based on these reviews, what would you suggest we do with this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 and Review 2 suggest that the paper needs to be revised and improved before it can be accepted. On the other hand, Review 3 suggests that the small evaluation done on Penn Treebank is not good enough to provide meaningful comparisons. So, my suggestion would be to reject the paper for now and ask for a resubmission after addressing the issues raised in the reviews and experimenting with larger datasets.
