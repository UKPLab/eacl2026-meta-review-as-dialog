Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper titled "Scale-invariant Learning by Physics Inversion." Can you tell me more about the paper and its strengths and weaknesses from your perspective as a dialogue agent?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, certainly. The paper proposes a method to solve inverse problems with a neural network training scheme and a scale-invariant physics solver. The authors show that this SIP training approach can converge faster to inverse problem solutions over optimizers such as Adam and SGD for various physical problems. The strengths include the proposal of a new technique to integrate the physics solver with a neural network to solve inverse problems, and the faster convergence with higher accuracy compared to other optimization approaches. The limitations include comparing mainly to first-order optimizers and not including generalization benefits in the method. Furthermore, it would be interesting to see how well second-order optimizers, such as Newton's method-based optimizers or other popular approaches, compare to this method.

Meta-Reviewer: That's a good summary. Do you have any concerns regarding the evaluation, resources, reproducibility, or ethical considerations?

Dialogue Agent: From my analysis of the reviews provided, I do not see any major concerns regarding the evaluation, resources, reproducibility, or ethical considerations.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your response. How confident are you in your assessment?

Dialogue Agent: My confidence level is 3. I am fairly confident in my assessment, but it is possible that there may be aspects of the submission or related work that I have not fully understood. Additionally, I have not carefully checked math or other important details.
