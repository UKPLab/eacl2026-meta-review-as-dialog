Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you tell me more about this paper on augmenting batches for better training?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper proposes a method for training deep learning models with larger batches by using data augmentation techniques to generate additional training data.

Meta-reviewer: I see. One review mentioned that the experiments are not strong and that the performance improvement may come from the larger batch size instead of the added augmented samples. Can you comment on this?

Dialogue agent: I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but I can confirm that the paper compares their method with standard small-batch training and reports improved performance on multiple datasets and architectures.

Meta-reviewer: Another review suggested that the benefits of the proposed method are unclear and that the experiments should have compared with stronger baselines. Can you provide more information on the baselines used in the paper?

Dialogue agent: The paper compares their method with standard small-batch training and reports improved performance. However, I do not have information on stronger baselines used in the experiments.

Meta-reviewer: One review suggested using other data augmentation methods instead of just Cutout for the image tasks, and another review suggested comparing the proposed regularization method with MixUp and other methods. Does the paper address these concerns?

Dialogue agent: I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but the paper discusses related work on regularization with transformed data and provides theoretical explanations for the proposed method. However, I do not have information on whether the paper addresses these specific concerns.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews and your answers, I am still concerned about the clarity and strength of the experimental results. Therefore, I am inclined to reject the paper. What is your confidence in the evaluations?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 rated the paper as a clear accept with a confidence of 3, while reviewers 1 and 3 rated the paper as ok but not good enough with a confidence of 4.
