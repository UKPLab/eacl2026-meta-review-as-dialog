 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Neural network architecture beyond width and depth":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Neural network architecture beyond width and depth". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors propose a novel neural network architecture that adds a new "height" dimension through a recursive construction. They show that their proposed network has better asymptotic error than standard ReLU networks when accounting for similar $O(n)$ number of parameters, and on a class of Lipschitz continuous functions.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the theoretical limitations of the proposed network?

Dialogue Agent: The authors discuss the theoretical limitations of their proposed network in their analysis, including the fact that the height dimension introduces additional computational burden, and that the network may not be as effective for certain types of functions.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: I see. What about the comparison with other related works? How does the proposed network compare to other neural network architectures that have been proposed in the literature?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention related works such as [Review 1: The authors propose a novel neural network architecture that adds a new "height" dimension through a recursive construction. The authors show that their proposed network has better asymptotic error than standard ReLU networks when accounting for similar $O(n)$ number of parameters, and on a class of Lipschitz continuous functions. Originality: (+) To the best of my knowledge this recursive "height" network architecture is novel. Quality: I looked at the proof but am unfamiliar field. Clarity: (+) The paper is well written and easy to understand, even for someone not up to date on theory of NN. Significance: (+) To my limited understanding the approximation error that these proposed networks achieve is meaningfully better than standard NNs. The authors describe theoretical limitations in their analysis, which I think are reasonable and am unconcerned about. |||| rating: 6: Weak Accept: Technically solid, moderate-to-high impact paper, with no major concerns with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility, ethical considerations. |||| confidence: 2: You are willing to defend your assessment, but it is quite likely that you did not understand the central parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.]

Dialogue Agent: The proposed network compares favorably to other neural network architectures that have been proposed in the literature, such as [Review 2: The paper proposes a new family of neural architectures which is given not just by width and depth but also by 'height', a newly introduced dimension. Such models are allowed to have activations that are themselves realized by other networks, resulting in an implicit parameter sharing scheme. Results on approximation theory are shown for such family of models, where they have better approximation properties than standard 'width/depth' networks. The paper is quite rigorous and the definitions are precise and formal. There is some minor repetition in the text (abstract/introduction), which could be removed to open up some space. Two weaknesses in my opinion: 1) There is no discussion/intuition/sketch of the proof of Theorem 2.1 in the main text. The construction given in the Appendix is important as it plays a major role in the theoretical results given in the paper, and a brief description of it would be valuable to have in the main text (and I believe enough space could be opened up by removing repeated text, wrapping Fig 3, etc). The organization of the Appendix could also be improved, since a reader looking for details on the construction used to prove Theorem 2.1 would go to Appendix A, then to B.1 and it is only in B.2 that the construction is given. This is a minor weakness as it is mostly regarding the organization of the manuscript, and had no impact on my final rating. 2) The discussion on how NestNets relate to models that have been previously proposed and adopted could be greatly expanded and improved. As the paper states, NestNets can be seen as 'standard' networks but with a specific parameter sharing scheme (this point could be given more significance in the text, as parameter sharing seems to be the main ingredient of NestNets and the cause of their expressive power).]

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I think the paper has some novel contributions and the authors have provided a solid analysis of the proposed network. However, I have some concerns about the practical limitations of the proposed network, such as the computational burden introduced by the height dimension. Can you help me understand the authors' view on these limitations?

Dialogue Agent: The authors discuss the practical limitations of their proposed network in their analysis, including the fact that the height dimension introduces additional computational burden, and that the network may not be as effective for certain types of functions. They also mention related works such as [Review 3: The paper presents a novel three-dimensional NN architecture. An additional dimension called height is introduced to empower the capacity of neural networks. A simple 257 experiment demonstrates the numerical advantages of the proposed method. The proof seems to be solid. However, I am not an expert in theory so I cannot judge the contribution of the proof. Overall, I think the idea of the paper is novel. Strengths- The three-dimensional NN architecture is a novel concept. The authors present theoretical proof to show their advantage with ReLu activations. The proof seems to be solid. Weaknesses- Although the method does not add extra parameters, the proposed three-dimensional NN significantly introduces an extra computational burden to iteratively activate the neurons (e.g., FLOPs during inference). It is good to present the computational burden of training and inference, and compare the performance against the computational burden.- The results of commonly-used benchmarks are preferred such as mnist, cifar, and ImageNet. There is no computational cost analysis and comparison, or experiments on real-world datasets.]

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and our conversation, I think the paper has some novel contributions and the authors have provided a solid analysis of the proposed network. However, I have some concerns about the practical limitations of the proposed network, such as the computational burden introduced by the height dimension. I would like to discuss these limitations further with the authors before making a final decision on the paper. Can you help me contact the authors?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I can provide you with the authors' contact information. Additionally, I can summarize the reviews and our conversation for you to use in your discussion with the authors. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
