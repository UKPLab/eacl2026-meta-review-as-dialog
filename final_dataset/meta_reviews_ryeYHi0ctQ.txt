 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "DPSNet: End-to-end Deep Plane Sweep Stereo":

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "DPSNet: End-to-end Deep Plane Sweep Stereo". Can you tell me a bit about the paper and its contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes an end-to-end learnable multiview stereo depth estimation network, which is similar to previous works like GCNet and PSMNet. The main contributions are the use of differential warps for cost volume computation and a multi-view averaging cost for final depth regression.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What do the reviews say about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The reviews are generally positive, but there are some suggestions for improvement. Reviewer 1 suggests that the paper could benefit from more discussion of DeepMVS and its differences with the proposed method. Reviewer 2 mentions that the evaluation metrics are mostly used for single-view depths and that the paper should be considered for comparison with MVSNet. Reviewer 3 found the contributions to be straightforward and suggests that more details are needed for Section 3.2.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Can you tell me more about the proposed method and how it differs from previous works?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The proposed method uses differential warps for cost volume computation, which allows for end-to-end training and improves the accuracy of depth estimation. The method also uses a multi-view averaging cost for final depth regression, which boosts performance. In comparison to previous works like GCNet and PSMNet, the proposed method uses a different architecture and training strategy, which leads to improved performance.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. What about the evaluation metrics used in the paper? Are they appropriate for measuring the performance of the proposed method?

Dialogue Agent: The paper uses standard evaluation metrics for stereo matching, such as mean squared error and mean absolute error. However, some reviewers suggest that these metrics may not be the most appropriate for comparing the proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods.

Turn 5:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. How does the proposed method compare to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance?

Dialogue Agent: The paper shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for MVS by a significant margin on several datasets. However, some reviewers suggest that the evaluation metrics used in the paper may not be the most appropriate for comparing the proposed method with other state-of-the-art methods.

Turn 6:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews and your summaries, I think I have a good understanding of the paper and its contributions.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I'm happy to help. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.
