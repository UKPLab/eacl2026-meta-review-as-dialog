 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Graph Transformer":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi there, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Graph Transformer" and I have some questions. Can you help me?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I have access to the reviews and can provide summarized answers based on the information provided. What would you like to know?

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: Great! I'd like to know more about the methodology used in the paper. The reviews mention that the paper proposes a graph transformer method to learn features from the data with a graph structure. Can you tell me more about this?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes an extension of the Transformer network to graph data, which allows for learning features from the data with a graph structure. The method uses a combination of positional encoding and self-attention to learn the features.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: That's interesting. I have some concerns about the methodology, though. The reviews mention that the paper proposes to use positional encoding for sequence input, but for graphs, edges have encoded the relative position information. Is it necessary to incorporate this positional encoding?

Dialogue Agent: Good question! The reviewer has raised a valid concern. The use of positional encoding for graphs is not necessary, as the edges already provide the relative position information. However, incorporating positional encoding could potentially improve the performance of the model. It might be worth conducting some experiments to verify this.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: Okay, that makes sense. Another concern I have is that the dataset used in the paper is not very large. How does the model perform on large-scale datasets?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer has raised a valid concern. The paper does not provide a large-scale dataset for evaluation. However, the authors do provide some experiments on few-shot learning, medical imaging classification, and graph classification problems, which show competitive performance. It might be worth conducting some experiments on larger datasets to evaluate the model's performance.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews and our conversation, I think I have a good understanding of the paper's methodology and contributions. What is your final assessment of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and our conversation, the paper appears to have some novelty in the use of the Transformer network for graph data, and the proposed method shows competitive performance on several benchmarks. However, the methodological novelty is somewhat limited due to the recent advancements in self-attention and message-passing graph modeling under various supervised settings. Additionally, the dataset used in the paper is not very large. Overall, I would rate the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help! Based on our conversation and the reviews, I agree with your assessment of the paper. I will use this information to make my final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.
