Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today. I have reviewed the reviews of the paper titled "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is a Sequence Modeling Problem" and have some questions regarding the paper. Are you ready?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Meta-Reviewer. I am ready to assist you.

Meta-Reviewer: Great. Let's start with Review 1. The reviewer appreciated the paper's application of Transformers' causal masked attention to the Multi-Agent Advantage Decomposition theorem, which is quite novel. However, they pointed out some weaknesses, such as the absence of a related work section, a potential mismatch in the results with MAPPO, and a lack of clarity in the few-shot experiments. Based on this, the reviewer gave a rating of 6, indicating a weak acceptance. What is your take on these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1's feedback on the paper's strengths is valid. We can confirm that the application of Transformers' causal masked attention to the Multi-Agent Advantage Decomposition theorem is indeed a novel aspect of the paper and that the experiments provide good insight into the Multi-Agent Transformer's performance. Regarding the weaknesses, we acknowledge that the absence of a related work section is a valid concern, and we'll make sure it is included in the next version. We have implemented MAPPO ourselves and have reported the results in the paper. We've also added further clarification to the few-shot experiments. Based on the reviewers' feedback, we think that the paper has addressed the major weaknesses. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Moving on to Review 2, the reviewer lauded the use of a transformer architecture in a multi-agent setting and the connection between the multi-agent advantage decomposition theorem. However, they expressed some concerns about the lack of related work that compares with UPDeT*, your claim about training sequential policies in parallel, and the usefulness of all the transformer components. What is your response to these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: We understand Review 2's concerns and appreciate the feedback provided. Regarding related work, although we have provided a brief discussion of prior works that use transformers in RL, Reviewer 2 is correct in that we should also consider UPDeT* and other related works that utilize transformers and the encoder-decoder structure. We will include these in the next version of the paper. As for the claim about training sequential policies in parallel, we refer to the parallelizability of transformers, which allows us to train the model in batch mode rather than sequentially. Finally, regarding the usefulness of the transformer components, Reviewer 2 is correct in pointing out that some of the components may not be necessary. We will conduct an ablation study to address this issue.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Finally, Review 3's feedback on the paper seemed positive overall, with praise for the use of state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence learning techniques and the improvement in performance, generalization, and few-shot learning capabilities as compared to MAPPO and HAPPO. However, the reviewer also mentioned some clarifications about the problem formulation, some minor comments about the figures, and the absence of a discussion of limitations and potential societal impact. What is your plan of action with regards to these issues raised by Review 3?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3's feedback is quite positive, and we appreciate the feedback they've provided. Regarding the issue of problem formulation, we are aware that our formulation represents a Markov game rather than a Dec-POMDP. We will address this issue and clarify the value functions accordingly. Regarding the minor comments about the figures, we will work to ensure that they are legible when printed. Lastly, we acknowledge that the paper does not discuss limitations and potential societal impact, and we will make sure to address this in the next version of the paper. 

Meta-Reviewer: I appreciate your thorough and thoughtful responses to the reviewers' concerns. Based on their feedback and your responses, I am confident that this paper will be a valuable contribution to the field. Therefore, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. Is there anything else you would like to add before we make a final decision?

Dialogue Agent: Thank you, Meta-Reviewer. We appreciate your consideration, and we are glad that we could address the reviewers' concerns. We have included a source code with our submission and will continue to work on improving the paper.
