Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you give me a summary of the reviews for "Accelerated Linearized Laplace Approximation for Bayesian Deep Learning"?

Dialogue agent: Sure, meta-reviewer. There are three reviews for this paper. Review 1 highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the article, focusing on the improvements made by ELLA in terms of performance in predictive mode and reducing cubic complexity in neural networks. However, the paper has some limitations, such as not discussing marginal likelihood estimation and having a weak connection to previous work in the field. Review 2 praises the paper's technical soundness and impact on Bayesian deep learning, specifically the proposed ELLA method's ability to cater to a wide range of performance/cost trade-offs by sweeping over hyperparameters. However, the review questions the fairness of the empirical comparison's memory and computational requirements, the lack of error bars, and the communication clarity of the paper's technical details. Review 3 finds the paper's novelty limited compared to similar papers in the field and proposes that the paper needs to explain more clearly its setting, goals, baseline methods, and hyperparameter choic. The review acknowledges the paper's technical soundness and scalability improvements, but it suggests that the authors should discuss the Nystrom approximation and investigate ELLA's better performance than the full model (LLA) more in detail.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Based on the reviews, what is your recommendation regarding accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue agent: The reviewers have different opinions on the paper's strengths and weaknesses, but all agree on the paper's technical soundness, scalability improvements, and impact on Bayesian deep learning; however, some open questions and limitations still need to be addressed. Review 1 suggests a weak acceptance of the paper, review 2 proposes a strong acceptance of the paper and suggests addressing some concerns raised, and review 3 suggests a borderline acceptance with aspects of the paper's novelty, communication clarity, and empirical evaluation that need clarification and improvement. Ultimately, the meta-reviewer needs to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence on the paper's strengths and weaknesses and decide whether to accept or reject the paper accordingly.
