Decision Maker: Hello, I am here to learn more about the debate topic - whether Obama's economic policies are working effectively. Can you provide me with information from both sides?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, there are arguments for and against the effectiveness of Obama's economic policies. Those for the policies argue that the comprehensive policy response by the administration, including efforts to shore up the financial system, stabilize the housing markets and fiscal stimulus has effectively brought an end to the Great Recession. Moreover, the policies have led to the GDP growth for the first time in over a year and a half and are creating jobs, however, there's still more work to do to completely solve the problems.

Decision Maker: That sounds quite positive. What about the arguments against the policies?

Dialogue Agent: The arguments against the policies suggest that while some positive effects from the policies are evident, they are not enough. The stimulus bill was not sufficient in its forecast and underestimated the state and local crisis, the policy also focused more on the redistribution of wealth rather than seeing jobs and the economy improve. Moreover, the policies are off the block, with only 25% of the dollars for infrastructure being spent, something that was promised to be shovel-ready; and it's believed that only a small piece of the policy, i.e. the Temporary relief for Unemployed Americans, has actually helped people. The policies also created a huge debt that  is growing, which is unsustainable and a threat to the future of the United States. 

Decision Maker: That's quite interesting, I can see that there are valid points to be made from both sides. Based on this information, what would you say is the conclusion regarding whether or not Obama's economic policies are working effectively?

Dialogue Agent: As a neutral party, I cannot form an opinion or decide what the conclusion is. It is up to you to review the arguments from both sides and make an informed decision.
