Buyer: Hi there, I'm interested in purchasing the album "Human" by Three Days Grace but I've heard mixed reviews about it. Can you tell me more about this album?

Agent: Sure. What would you like to know?

Buyer: Are the topics timely and relevant on this album?

Agent: According to the reviews, the topics on this album are indeed timely and relevant.

Buyer: How about the sound? Do you think it's still Three Days Grace's signature sound?

Agent: The reviews say that the sound is 100% what you'd expect from Three Days Grace, and it doesn't feel like a band that has dramatically changed despite the recent loss.

Buyer: That’s good to hear. But I've also read that the lyrics on the album are uninspired. Is that true?

Agent: Based on the reviews, the lyrics on the single "Human Race" fall flat and come across as uninspired, with "yeah" being extremely overused to the point of being irritating. However, it seems that each song is lyrically written with a few very nice and meaningful lines.

Buyer: I see. And how does the new singer compare to the previous one?

Agent: One review mentions that the new singer is just as good as their previous one, although the range of the band with the new singer was limited compared to their previous work.

Buyer: Hmm, that's something to consider. Is there anything else I should know about this album before making a decision to buy it?

Agent: Another reviewer mentioned that they loved the album but found the sound quality to be a bit less than their previous works.

Buyer: Thanks for sharing that. I think I have everything I need to make a decision now.

Agent: You’re welcome. Do you need any more information before making your decision?

Buyer: No, I think I have enough information. I’ll take a chance and make the purchase. Thanks for your assistance!

Agent: You're welcome, happy to help.
