 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Subspace Clustering via Robust Self-Supervised Convolutional Neural Network":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I am reviewing a paper titled "Subspace Clustering via Robust Self-Supervised Convolutional Neural Network". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors propose a robust self-supervised convolutional neural network for subspace clustering, which can handle data corruptions and improve the performance of the method.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the loss function used in this method?

Dialogue Agent: The authors use a correntropy induced metric (CIM) loss function to ensure a smooth decrease of the loss function and enable the use of label-free stopping criterion.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I have some concerns about the limited novelty of this work. The only novel point is the CIM loss of the representation error of Z in Eq.(4) and (5). What do you think about this?

Dialogue Agent: The authors acknowledge the limited novelty of their work and mention that their main contribution is the use of CIM as a loss function to improve the robustness of the method.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the comparison of the proposed method with other deep subspace clustering methods?

Dialogue Agent: The authors compare their method with shallow subspace clustering methods such as SSC and EnSC, and show that their method outperforms these methods in certain settings. However, the reviewer mentions that the comparison is not fair and that a possible fair way to compare the performance of the two methods would be to use an "unseen" dataset.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews, I think this paper has some interesting contributions, but the presentation needs improvement. Can you tell me more about the presentation style of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that the presentation style of the paper needs improvement, and suggest that the differences in Figure 1 should be clearly stated and the presentation flow should be carefully addressed. The reviewer also mentions that the paper is modified from [2], but the presentation flow is not carefully addressed.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews, I think this paper has some interesting contributions, but the presentation needs improvement. Can you tell me more about the hyperparameters used in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that the hyperparameters used in the paper are not explicitly stated, and suggest that including the model structure and the hyperparameters used would be helpful for further evaluation and comparison.

Turn 7:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews, I think this paper has some interesting contributions, but the presentation needs improvement. Can you tell me more about the permutation space of [k] in (11)?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that the permutation space of [k] in (11) is not explicitly stated, and suggest that including the permutation space would be helpful for further evaluation and comparison.

Turn 8:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews, I think this paper has some interesting contributions, but the presentation needs improvement. Can you tell me more about the training time in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that the training time in the paper is not explicitly stated, and suggest that including the training time would be helpful for further evaluation and comparison.

Turn 9:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews, I think this paper has some interesting contributions, but the presentation needs improvement. Can you tell me more about the device used in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that the device used in the paper is a GPU, but no further details are provided.

Turn 10:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews, I think this paper has some interesting contributions, but the presentation needs improvement. Can you tell me more about the reference list used in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that the reference list used in the paper is not explicitly stated, and suggest that including the reference list would be helpful for further evaluation and comparison.

The output should feature only the dialogue, without duplicated sentences, and the dialogue agent should present answers in a summarized form without bullet points. The meta-reviewer may ask follow-up questions, and their final decision involves weighing the importance of reviewer confidence.
