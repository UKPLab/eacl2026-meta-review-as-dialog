Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for providing me with the reviews for the paper "Lean-Interaction: passive image manipulation in concurrent multitasking." Based on these reviews, I am now in the process of making a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you help me understand the key findings and concerns from each reviewer?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Review 1 provided a rating of 5, which is marginally below the acceptance threshold. The reviewer found the paper to be well-structured and easy to follow, but questioned the justification for abstracting the original complex task and criticized the lack of evaluation of the final designs by radiologists.

Review 2 gave the paper a rating of 8 and clear acceptance. The reviewer appreciated the well-written paper, the clear explanation of the research questions, and the grounded discussion of multimodal interaction in the literature. However, the reviewer suggested that the choices of interaction modalities seemed somewhat arbitrary and recommended further exploration of alternate motivations.

Review 3 strongly recommended rejection of the paper, giving a rating of 3. The reviewer questioned the focus of the paper, whether it was aiming to solve the specific problem of image navigation and zooming while doing catheter insertion or a generic multitasking scenario. Furthermore, the reviewer criticized the disregard for the most prominent alternative - using the foot for interaction - and suggested that the explicit start/stop may not make sense for head gestures. The reviewer also questioned the task specifics and the lack of evaluation of counterbalancing in the study.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. It seems that there are mixed opinions on the paper, with one reviewer supporting acceptance, one suggesting minor revisions, and another recommending rejection. How confident are the reviewers in their findings?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 expressed a confidence of 4, indicating confidence but not absolute certainty in their evaluation. Review 2, on the other hand, expressed a confidence of 5, indicating absolute certainty in their evaluation and familiarity with the relevant literature. Finally, Review 3 expressed a confidence of 4, indicating confidence but not absolute certainty in their evaluation.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on these reviews, I am still uncertain about the paper and would like to have a better understanding of the paper type. Can you tell me the type of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the type of the paper is long.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Given the mixed opinions and the length of the paper, I think it would be best to gather more information before making a decision. Is there any additional information that can help me understand the paper more clearly?

Dialogue Agent: Unfortunately, I am unable to provide any opinions or recommendations, but I can provide more information on the methodology, results, or discussion if you would like.

Meta-Reviewer: Based on these reviews and the paper type, I think it would be best to gather more information from the authors before making a decision. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
