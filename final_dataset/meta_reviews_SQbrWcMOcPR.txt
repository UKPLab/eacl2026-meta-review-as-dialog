 Sure, here's a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Scalable and Efficient Training of Large Convolutional Neural Networks with Differential Privacy":

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper titled "Scalable and Efficient Training of Large Convolutional Neural Networks with Differential Privacy". Can you help me understand the key contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper presents a new technique called "mixed ghost clipping" for training large convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with differential privacy (DP). This technique allows for scalable and efficient training of CNNs with DP, which is a long-standing open problem in the field.

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the mixed ghost clipping technique?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The technique is based on the idea of ghost clipping, which was introduced in a previous work [32]. Ghost clipping is a method for training linear layers with DP by clipping the gradients of each sample to a fixed norm. However, this method can be computationally expensive and may not be scalable for large CNNs. The authors propose a mixed ghost clipping method that adapts the ghost clipping technique to convolutional layers, which allows for more efficient and scalable training of large CNNs with DP.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. So, what are the main strengths and weaknesses of this paper, in your opinion?

Dialogue Agent: The main strengths of the paper are its technical contributions and the experimental results. The paper presents a novel technique for training large CNNs with DP, which is a significant contribution to the field. The authors also provide extensive experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. However, the authors do not provide a detailed comparison with other works in the field, which could be a weakness. Additionally, the authors claim that they are the first to train convolutional ViTs under DP, but [33] also trained DP models with ViTs.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on your assessment, would you recommend accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the technical contributions and experimental results presented in the paper, I would recommend accepting the paper with a high confidence level. However, I would suggest that the authors provide a more detailed comparison with other works in the field to strengthen their contributions.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help! I will consider your feedback in my decision.
