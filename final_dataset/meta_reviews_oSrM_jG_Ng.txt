 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "The Benefit of Distraction: Denoising Remote Vitals Measurements Using Inverse Attention". The meta-reviewer is aware only of the paper's title and relies on the dialogue agent, equipped with reviews and paper type information, to make a final decision.

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me about the main contribution of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new method for denoising remote vitals measurements using inverse attention. The proposed approach uses the low attention regions to estimate a model of the signal noise, which can improve the performance of the denoising component.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the motivation behind this work?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper describes an interesting approach and contains valuable insights into the limitations of attention-based approaches in noisy signals. The authors propose using the inverse attention mask to select contextual information to learn noise representation, which can improve the denoising performance.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the strengths and weaknesses of this paper, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to the reviews, the paper has several strengths, including the novelty of the proposed approach and the valuable insights into the limitations of attention-based approaches. However, the reviews also mention some weaknesses, such as the lack of motivation for the proposed method and the limited evaluation of the proposed approach using three datasets.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: Can you summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Review 1 states that the paper proposes an interesting approach and contains valuable insights into the limitations of attention-based approaches. However, the reviewer is not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. Review 2 states that the paper presents a new method for the camera-based physiological measurement task, but the reviewer has several main concerns, such as the lack of motivation for the proposed method and the limited evaluation of the proposed approach using three datasets. Review 3 states that the paper is interesting, but the assumption used in the paper does not hold, and the novelty of the proposed method is quite limited.

Turn 5:
Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews, what is your recommendation for accepting or rejecting this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would recommend rejecting the paper due to the limited evaluation of the proposed approach and the lack of motivation for the proposed method. However, the paper does contain valuable insights into the limitations of attention-based approaches, and the proposed approach shows promise for future research.

Turn 6:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. I will consider your recommendation and make a final decision based on the reviews and the paper's content.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I'm here to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have.
