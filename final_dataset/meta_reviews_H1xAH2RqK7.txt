Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I would like to discuss the reviews for the paper "Generative Adversarial Models for Learning Private and Fair Representations". Can you tell me a little bit about what the paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. The paper presents an adversarial-based approach for learning private and fair representations, which is done by distorting the data while minimizing the dependency on sensitive variables and constraining the degree of distortion. The problem is analyzed from game-theory and information theory perspectives.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Can you outline the main points in Review 1?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 found the paper to provide a good overview of related work in Private/Fair Representation Learning (PRL) and is well-written. The author's theoretical approach is thoroughly explained and easy to follow. The paper demonstrates the model's performance on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and the comparison between the theoretical and data-driven performance is a good case study to understand PRL. However, the reviewer had some concerns that the GMM study case incorporates strong assumptions and that important parts of the paper have been put in the appendices.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Now, can you tell me what Review 2 says?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 thinks that the problem addressed is important and the analysis from game-theory and information theory perspectives is interesting. However, Review 2 found some contradictions with the commonly accepted meaning of representation learning and thinks that the paper is quite similar to a previous work by Edwards and Storkey from 2015. The reviewer also had some concerns about the clarity of the proposition, and the presentation can be improved.

Meta-Reviewer: Alright. And what were the main points in Review 3?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 found the paper to be well-written and easy to follow. The author summarizes the literature and formalizes the problem. However, the distortions can be a very restrictive constraint, and the paper's experiments are somewhat limited, which may lead to overlooking certain insights. 

Meta-Reviewer: Based on these reviews, what is your recommendation? 

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 and Review 2 both rated the paper as "Ok but not good enough - rejection", while Review 3 recommended acceptance with improvements. Therefore, it's difficult to make a recommendation without knowing the weight of each reviewer's confidence. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Can you please tell me the confidence rating for each review?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 and 2 both rated their confidence as 3, which is "fairly confident that the evaluation is correct". Reviewer 3 rated their confidence as 3 as well. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on these ratings, I think we should reject the paper. Is there anything else you want to add?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I am available to assist with any further questions or discussions you may have.
