Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am reviewing a paper titled "Embodied Third-Person Virtual Locomotion using a Single Depth Camera." The paper type is long, and I have three reviews. Can you give me a summary of the reviews before we proceed?

Dialogue agent: Sure, meta-reviewer. Review 1 rates the paper slightly above the acceptance threshold with a confidence level of 3. Review 2 rates the paper as a clear accept and in the top 50% of accepted papers with a confidence level of 4. Review 3 rates the paper as good and accepts it with a confidence level of 3.

Meta-reviewer: That's useful. Can you tell me what the paper explores?

Dialogue agent: The paper explores the third-person perspective in virtual reality (VR) using a single depth camera for skeletal tracking, which is then used for virtual locomotion. The authors conducted a user study to compare locomotion and interaction through head tilt as an option for locomotion and a controller as the other option.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. Can you provide more details about the user study? 

Dialogue agent: The user study in the paper was well-designed and conducted, even though COVID-19 impacted the number of participants. However, there were some issues identified in Review 2 and 3 about the virtual environment and the small sample size. Review 2 felt that the introduction and background sections could be simplified for a clearer outline of the research problem. Review 3 suggested that the virtual environment was too straightforward, making the comparison between locomotion techniques simplified and trivial. A better way of conducting the user study would be to create a more complex virtual environment where target locations are obscured from the user's view. 

Meta-reviewer: That's a helpful view. Can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. Review 1 has a moderate confidence level, Review 2 has a high confidence level, and Review 3 has a moderate confidence level.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on the reviews and the paper, do you have any recommendations or suggestions on whether to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue agent: Sorry, meta-reviewer, as a dialogue agent, I am not programmed to provide suggestions or recommendations. However, I can help you weigh the importance of reviewer confidence levels while making the final decision. 

Meta-reviewer: Sure, that will be helpful. Based on my assessment, there are some issues with the paper's user study methodology, but the paper itself is well-written and the proposed method is presented clearly. However, as the user study is a crucial aspect of this research paper, it is important to consider the comments made by reviewers 2 and 3 about the virtual environment and the small sample size. Reviewer 2 suggests that the paper is unnecessarily complex in some sections but still a good piece of work. Reviewer 3 suggests that while the study is well-done, there is room for improvement in the virtual environment and user study methodology. Therefore, I think acceptance is possible, but with certain conditions like conducting a more complex study or adding more detail to the virtual environment. The confidence levels of the reviewers also indicate that there is some divergence in their opinions.

Dialogue agent: That is a valid viewpoint, meta-reviewer. Based on the confidence levels, the reviewers have moderately high confidence in their evaluations, and there is a fair amount of agreement in some aspects of the paper. However, there are also some disagreements between reviewers that must be considered while making the final decision.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help, dialogue agent. I will weigh the reviewers' comments and confidence levels while making the final decision.
