 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "DEEP ADVERSARIAL FORWARD MODEL":

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm evaluating the paper "DEEP ADVERSARIAL FORWARD MODEL" for acceptance or rejection. Can you provide a summary of the paper's main contributions and any notable limitations?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper "DEEP ADVERSARIAL FORWARD MODEL" proposes a novel approach to training forward models for reinforcement learning tasks. The authors use a deep adversarial forward model that combines an adversarial loss with an InfoGAN-inspired loss and a content loss. The proposed approach aims to improve the prediction of future frames in a reinforcement learning setting.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the notable limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: One notable limitation of the paper is that it does not provide a comprehensive comparison with existing works in the field. The authors mention some related works, but they do not provide a detailed comparison of their approach with these works. Additionally, the paper does not provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach in different scenarios, which would be useful to assess its generalizability.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What about the reviewers' comments? Do they have any suggestions for improvement?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the reviewers have provided some suggestions for improvement. One reviewer suggests that the authors should provide a more detailed comparison with existing works in the field and evaluate their approach in different scenarios. Another reviewer suggests that the authors should provide more experimental results to support their claims.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviewers' comments and your summary, I will consider the paper's acceptance or rejection.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! If you have any further questions or need more information, please don't hesitate to ask.
