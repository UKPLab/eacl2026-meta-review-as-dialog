Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "FTSO: Effective NAS via First Topology Second Operator." Review 1 recommends rejecting the paper, Review 2 suggests a rating just below acceptance threshold, and Review 3 suggests rejecting the paper. Can you confirm that these are the only reviews available? 

Dialogue Agent: Yes, those are the only reviews available for this long paper on FTSO.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. I am particularly concerned about Review 1's low rating and strong confidence. Can you explain what the main issue was with the paper according to that review?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1's main concern was the poor quality of presentation, especially with respect to the readability of some figures and lack of code to check the empirical results. Although the proposed approach was interesting and showed good results, Review 1 believed that the paper needed a lot more work.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what about the other two reviews? Were they also concerned about the quality of presentation?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 had some issues with the theoretical analysis and clarity of the paper in some sections. However, they found the proposed method interesting and competitive with other NAS methods. They recommended a rating just below the acceptance threshold. Review 3 also had some concerns with the clarity of the paper, especially in some of the technical descriptions and experimental results. They also recommended rejecting the paper.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Given these reviews, how confident are you in the final decision to accept or reject the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide my opinion, but I can tell you that the decision ultimately depends on your interpretation of the reviews and the importance you place on the issues raised by each reviewer. You may also want to consider the confidence levels of each review and the type of paper (long) in making your decision.
