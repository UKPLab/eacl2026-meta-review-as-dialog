Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am reviewing the paper "A Convergent Variant of the Boltzmann Softmax Operator in Reinforcement Learning". Based on the submitted reviews, I'd like to ask you some questions to help me make a decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Hello, Meta-Reviewer. I'll do my best to answer your questions based on the reviews and without providing opinions or recommendations.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Let's start with Review 1. Can you tell me more about the proposed dynamic Boltzmann operator (DBS), and how it achieves convergence to V* and Q*?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. According to Review 1, the dynamic Boltzmann operator replaces the traditional max operator in value iteration and Q-learning, and is time-varying with a beta parameter that depends solely on time rather than state visitation. Empirical results showed performance gains of DBS+Q-learning over Q-learning in a gridworld, and DBS+DQN over DQN on Atari games. 

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. Review 1 also raises concerns about clarity and soundness of the paper. Can you address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Yes. Review 1 pointed out that it is unclear in the DBS Q-learning algorithm how actions are selected under the policy, and that if the Boltzmann distribution is used, the algorithm presented is actually expected SARSA and not Q-learning. Furthermore, the proof of Theorem 4 implicitly assumes that all states are visited infinitely often, which may not be true with the given algorithm. Review 1 suggests that the non-expansive property may not be vital to guarantee the convergence of the learning algorithm. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Let's move on to Review 2. Can you provide more information about the theoretical results and issues raised in this review?

Dialogue Agent: Yes. Review 2 noted that Theorem 1 is straightforward but Corollary 1 may be technically wrong, though this can be fixed by replacing the lim with a limsup. The reviewer also stated that stronger conditions are required on the sequence beta_t for Theorem 4, similar to what is discussed in the paragraph on Boltzmann exploration in Section 2.2 of Singh et al 2000. The proof provided by the authors relies on a "Lemma 2" which cannot be found in the paper. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the explanation. Finally, let's discuss Review 3, which raises concerns about the claims made in the paper regarding exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Can you offer more insight into this review?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. According to Review 3, the paper's claims about exploration-exploitation tradeoff are misguided, since the tradeoff in RL concerns exploitation of understood knowledge versus deep-directed exploration, rather than just annealing between the max action and the mean over all actions without incorporating any notion of uncertainty. The reviewer suggests that the paper needs to reposition its main claims about exploration, as Theorem 4 does not guarantee efficient exploration, and the same proof applies to vanilla Q-learning, which is known not to explore well. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews and your responses, I have a better understanding of the paper's strengths and weaknesses. I am concerned about some of the issues raised regarding clarity, soundness, and claims regarding exploration, but I also recognize the paper's empirical results and potential contribution to the field. What is your overall recommendation, dialogue agent?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide a recommendation or opinion. However, I can summarize the reviews to help you make a decision. Review 1 points out several concerns about clarity and soundness, but acknowledges the novel error bound and empirical results of the proposed method. Review 2 raises issues with the theoretical results and proofs of the paper. Review 3 questions the paper's claims about exploration-exploitation tradeoff and suggests a repositioning of the main claims. Overall, the paper may benefit from further improvement before it can be accepted for publication.
