Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your reviews, I have carefully read through all of them. Could you please clarify some of the points raised in Review 1? The reviewer seems to have several concerns about the logic of the paper and the validity of the evaluation.

Dialogue agent: Certainly. Review 1 raises several valid points, particularly regarding the clarity of the paper and the evaluation methodology. The response to the comment about assuming that documents are produced from a single topic is that while this assumption may not always hold in practice, it simplifies the model and allows for a more interpretable output. As for the claim about outperforming LDA through the use of a deep generative model, we acknowledge that further evidence is necessary to support this claim.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for addressing those issues. Could you now please discuss the issues raised in Review 2?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 raises valid concerns about the lack of clarity in some parts of the paper, particularly regarding the interpretation of latent topics and the contribution of the word sequence generator. We acknowledge that more detail could be provided in these areas. Additionally, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation methodology, including additional comparison metrics and more advanced conventional models.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. And what about the comments raised in Review 3?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 provides a generally positive evaluation of the paper, but suggests that more detail could be provided on the methodology and that more comprehensive evaluation metrics could be used. We agree that providing a more technical description of the algorithms would be helpful. As for the lack of comparison with other related models, we acknowledge that additional baselines could be added for a more thorough evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. I have one final question regarding the confidence levels of the reviewers. Review 1 and Review 2 seem to express a low level of confidence in their evaluations, while Review 3 is more positive. How important should I consider reviewer confidence in making my final decision?

Dialogue agent: While confidence levels can provide some indication of the reviewer's overall impression of the paper, the importance of reviewer confidence should be weighed against the substance of their critiques. A low confidence level may indicate uncertainty on the part of the reviewer, but it does not necessarily mean that their critique is less valid. Similarly, a high confidence level does not necessarily mean that the critique is more valid. In making your final decision, it would be advisable to carefully consider all of the feedback provided by the reviewers and to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of the paper against the criteria set for acceptance.
