 Sure, here's a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Certifying Robust Graph Classification under Orthogonal Gromov-Wasserstein Threats":

Turn 1:
Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Certifying Robust Graph Classification under Orthogonal Gromov-Wasserstein Threats". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors propose a robustness certificate for graph classifiers under orthogonal Gromov-Wasserstein threats, which are sensitive to whether two graphs are isomorphic. They use a convex relaxation of the resistance distance as the underlying metric, and derive a convex lower bound of OGW via Fenchel biconjugation.

Turn 2:
Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. But I'm not sure if I fully understand the motivation behind using the Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy. Can you explain that to me?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The authors choose to use the Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy because it is a more robust measure of graph distance than traditional methods such as shortest path distance, which can be sensitive to node orderings. The Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancy is a measure of how much two graphs differ in terms of their geometric structure, and is more resistant to node reorderings.

Turn 3:
Meta-reviewer: I see. But I have some concerns about the experimental evaluation. The certificates and attacks are only evaluated on a single layer linear GCN, and most of the experiments are performed with a fixed local budget. Can you address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: The authors acknowledge these limitations and suggest that the certificate can be applied to more complex models and budgets. However, they do not provide explicit results for these cases. Additionally, the authors note that the final threat model is not as interpretable as simple edge perturbations, but provide some intuition on the motivation behind the certificate.

Turn 4:
Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews, I think the paper is technically solid and has high impact, but the experimental evaluation could be improved. What is your assessment of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I agree that the paper is technically solid and has high impact, but the experimental evaluation could be improved. I would rate the paper as a weak accept, with a confidence level of 5.

Turn 5:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help. I think I have a good understanding of the paper now.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, please don't hesitate to ask.
