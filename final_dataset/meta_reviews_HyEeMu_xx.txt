 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Progressive Attention Networks for Visual Attribute Prediction":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Progressive Attention Networks for Visual Attribute Prediction". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper presents an architecture that incrementally attends to image regions at multiple layers of a deep CNN, rather than applying a weighted average pooling in the earlier layers. The approach is novel and interesting, and the authors provide results on two datasets, one simulated and one real.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What do the reviewers think of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Reviewer 1 finds the approach to be novel and interesting, but notes that there is no significant performance gain on any standard datasets. Reviewer 2 believes that the idea of progressive attention on features is good, but has been done before, and notes that there is a lack of novelty and no significant results. Reviewer 3 thinks that the paper is well-executed and provides good experimental results and qualitative visualizations, but believes that experiments on a dataset like VQA are missing.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Thanks for summarizing the reviews. What is your assessment of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper presents an interesting and novel approach to progressive attention in deep neural networks. However, the experimental evaluation could be improved with more detailed evaluation, comparisons, and qualitative results. Additionally, the lack of significant performance gain on standard datasets and the lack of novelty noted by Reviewer 2 may be considered by the meta-reviewer when making a final decision.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your summary. Based on the reviews and your assessment, I am leaning towards rejecting the paper due to the lack of significant performance gain and the lack of novelty. However, I would like to hear your thoughts on the matter before making a final decision.

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the authors' claims, it seems that the paper's contribution is primarily in the area of progressive attention, rather than significant performance gain on standard datasets. The lack of novelty noted by Reviewer 2 may also be a consideration. However, the authors do provide good experimental results and qualitative visualizations, which may be taken into account by the meta-reviewer when making a final decision.
