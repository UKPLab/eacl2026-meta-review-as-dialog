Meta-Reviewer: Thank you all for your insightful reviews and comments on this paper. Overall, it seems like the paper is providing an interesting investigation into the expressive power of graph neural networks, especially focusing on their discriminative power. I appreciate Reviewer 1's thorough analysis of the paper's limitations and suggestions for improvement, as well as the authors' responses to those concerns. Reviewer 2 also raises some important points regarding the clarity of the paper's claims and exposition of Theorem 3, and it's great to see those issues have been addressed in the revised version. Finally, Reviewer 3's insights into the broader context of the paper's contributions and potential limitations are also valuable in evaluating its significance. 

After considering all the reviews and the authors' responses, I am happy to recommend the acceptance of this paper. Its findings should be of interest to the community working on GNNs and related topics, and the experiments presented provide strong support for the claims made in the paper. However, I do want to emphasize that the limitations and assumptions of the paper's analysis should be made clear, and it would be helpful to see more discussion on the potential limitations of the paper's findings. Overall, though, I think this is a valuable contribution to the field.
