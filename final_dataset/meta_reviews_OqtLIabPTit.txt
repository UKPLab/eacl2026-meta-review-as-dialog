Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Exploring Balanced Feature Spaces for Representation Learning," and I have a few questions before I make my final decision. Can you answer them for me?

Dialogue Agent: Of course, Meta-reviewer. I will do my best to answer your questions based on the reviews and the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Reviewer 1 asked if Figure 1 is hypothetical or real. Can you clarify that for me?

Dialogue Agent: I can provide clarification. According to the paper, Figure 1 is hypothetical and shows a desired outcome for the performance metric. It is not based on actual observations.

Meta-reviewer: Good to know. Reviewer 1 also had a minor comment on the use of language. Can you clarify that as well?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Reviewer 1 suggested that the authors should not refer to their contributions as "important" and allow others to decide. It was just a minor style comment and not a major concern.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Another question from Reviewer 1 was about Equation (3). Can you provide an intuitive explanation and motivation for it?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Equation (3) is the balanced loss function proposed in the paper. It aims to balance the number of samples in each class to improve the performance of the classifier on long-tailed datasets. The motivation for this equation is to prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class. However, Reviewer 1 noted that the metric may not be robust for measuring performance.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Reviewer 1 also asked if there is a tradeoff between accuracy and balancedness. Can you explain this in more detail?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper discusses that there may be a tradeoff between accuracy and balancedness, as shown in Figure 2. Reviewer 1 suggested that a combined loss function, such as CE + CL or CE + KCL, could potentially achieve the best of both worlds. However, the paper did not explore these options thoroughly.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Reviewer 1 also noted a mistake in the computation of the delta for VOC in Table 1 and that there were no numbers on the y-axis of Figure 7. Can you confirm this?

Dialogue Agent: I can confirm that those were concerns raised by Reviewer 1.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Another question I had was about Reviewer 2's concern regarding the use of the balancedness metric in Equation (3). What do you think about this?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2 suggested that the balancedness metric may not be an appropriate measure of performance and proposed alternative metrics. The paper did not address this concern directly but did acknowledge the limitations of the metric.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Reviewer 2 also had concerns about the experiments' clarity, particularly with training linear classifiers in a balanced set. Can you explain this further?

Dialogue Agent: According to Reviewer 2, training linear classifiers with a balanced set does not comply with learning from an imbalanced dataset. Reviewer 2 suggested that the experiments would have been stronger if they included results of a trained linear classifier on the learned embedding to demonstrate the impact of a contrastive loss for learning from imbalanced datasets.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the clarification. Finally, Review 3 had concerns about the paper's contribution and runtime compared to a previous work and the interpretation of accuracy on ImageNet in Figure 4. Can you respond to those?

Dialogue Agent: According to Reviewer 3, a previous work had already established the importance of using self-supervised learning to combat label bias issue in imbalanced problems. Reviewer 3 also noted that the runtime of the proposed method is much worse than supervised-based methods. Additionally, Reviewer 3 asked why the authors chose to use a cosine lr schedular and questioned the interpretation of accuracies in Figure 4 and why only ten classes were used.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the detailed responses. Based on these reviews and your explanations, I feel confident that I can make an informed decision. Thank you for your assistance, Dialogue Agent.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, Meta-reviewer. It was my pleasure to assist you.
