Meta-reviewer: Thank you both for your reviews. Reviewer 1, you have raised some technical concerns about the paper's claims and methods, as well as concerns about the style and tone of the paper. Reviewer 2, you have provided a positive review and suggested some directions for future work. 

As the meta-reviewer, I agree with Reviewer 1's technical concerns about the paper, especially regarding the differences between the presented Simple and Learned algorithms, and the lack of evaluation on different CPU architectures or benchmark suites. Additionally, I share Reviewer 1's concerns about the style and tone of the paper, and believe that this is an important factor to consider, especially in the academic community. Therefore, I lean towards a rejection of the paper.

However, Reviewer 2's positive critique of the paper and suggestions for future work are also valid. I can see value in further explorations of techniques for parameter tuning and the impact of different datasets. Therefore, if the authors can address the technical concerns raised by Reviewer 1 and make revisions to the style and tone of the paper, I am open to reconsidering the paper for acceptance.

Overall, given the strengths and weaknesses pointed out by both reviewers, I would suggest a major revision and further discussion with the authors to address the concerns and improve the paper.
