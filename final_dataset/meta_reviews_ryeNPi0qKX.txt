Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I have reviewed the paper titled "Language Modeling Teaches You More Syntax than Translation Does: Lessons Learned Through Auxiliary Task Analysis" along with its reviews. Based on the reviews, I found that the paper has mixed reactions from the reviewers. Can you give me more insight into the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, certainly. The paper is a long one, and it analyzes various pre-training methods and their effectiveness on sequence tagging tasks such as POS and CCG.

Meta-Reviewer: What about the quality of the paper? Are there any major issues to consider?

Dialogue Agent: The quality of the paper is generally good. However, some reviewers had concerns about the significance of the paper's contributions. Reviewer 1 found the basic research question to be of minor interest, while Reviewer 2 thinks that there is not enough here for an ICLR submission.

Meta-Reviewer: Do you think these concerns are valid?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I can't provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can say that Reviewer 1 rated the paper 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold, while Reviewer 2 rated the paper 5, which is marginally below the acceptance threshold.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about Reviewer 3?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3 gave the paper a rating of 7 and recommended acceptance, but had a question regarding Table 1. They wanted to know which one of the "LM forward" models was used in the subsequent experiments and whether the input embeddings for the random init LSTM pre-trained or randomly initialized.

Meta-Reviewer: These reviews are giving me mixed signals. How confident are the reviewers about their evaluations?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 both had a confidence level of 4, which means they are confident, but not absolutely certain that their evaluation is correct. Reviewer 3 also had a confidence level of 4.

Meta-Reviewer: Given all this information, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. What do you think?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can say that based on Reviewer 3's rating and recommendation, it seems that the paper is of good quality and should be accepted. However, the final decision rests in your hands.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your assistance. I have made my decision, and I will accept the paper.
