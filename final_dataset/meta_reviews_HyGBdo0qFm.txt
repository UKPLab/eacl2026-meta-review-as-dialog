Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm the meta-reviewer assigned to evaluate your paper "On the Turing Completeness of Modern Neural Network Architectures."

Dialogue agent: Hello, it's good to have you here.

Meta-reviewer: I've read through the reviews for your paper, and I have a few questions. Reviewer 1 suggested that the paper needs to be revised and clarified. How do you respond to that?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can clarify that the paper presents interesting theoretical results on Turing completeness of modern neural architectures such as the Transformer and the Neural GPU. The paper mentions that the technical results are potentially strong, but there may be a need for revision to clarify ideas. 

Meta-reviewer: That's fair enough. What about Reviewer 2, who mentioned that the paper is too long and may be better suited for a journal?

Dialogue agent: The paper discusses original and significant theoretical progress and is well-written. As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but I can mention that Reviewer 2 also rated the paper a 7 out of 10, which indicates that it's a good paper and worthy of acceptance.

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful information. Lastly, Reviewer 3 had a few unanswered questions regarding the approximations used for the proof and how these models are used in real-world scenarios. Can you provide any additional clarity?

Dialogue agent: The authors note that the conditions involved in the proofs for Turing completeness of both the Transformer and the Neural GPU are not how these models are used in the real world. Hence, the approximation concerns raised by Reviewer 3 are of theoretical interest. The paper presents clear proofs, but real-world implications need further investigation. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on these reviews, it seems like the paper has merit but could benefit from some revisions. Given that Reviewer 2 rated it highly, I'm leaning towards acceptance. However, Reviewer 1's concerns about clarity make me hesitant. Can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1's confidence level is 2, which means that the reviewer is willing to defend their evaluation, but there is a likelihood that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper. Similarly, Reviewer 2's confidence level is also 2, indicating that the reviewer is willing to defend their evaluation but may have misunderstood some aspects of the paper. Reviewer 3's confidence level is also 2, indicating a willingness to defend the evaluation, but with a possibility of misunderstanding some of the paper's central parts as well. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that information. It appears that all three reviewers have some doubts about the paper but still rate it highly. Given the technical nature of the paper, I'm willing to accept it with some minor revisions to address Reviewer 1's concerns. Thank you for your responses, and I'll be recommending acceptance with revisions to the board. 

Dialogue agent: Thank you for your time, and we'll be happy to address any concerns during the revision process.
