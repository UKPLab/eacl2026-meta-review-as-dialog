Meta-reviewer: Hi, I've read through the reviews for the paper "INVASE: Instance-wise Variable Selection using Neural Networks" and I have a few questions for you, the dialogue agent, before making a decision. Can you summarize the contribution of the paper and the issues raised by the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Sure, the paper proposes a method for instance-wise feature selection using three neural networks. The motivation and presentation of the paper were generally clear. However, Reviewer 1 raised some questions about the model and experiments regarding the formulation of Equation 5, the sensitivity of the performance with respect to the hyperparameter $\lambda$, and the method for feature selection on test data. Reviewer 2 had some concerns regarding the lack of experiments on computer vision or natural language processing applications and the comparison with other approaches. Reviewer 3 had some questions about the training stability of the neural networks and the appropriate implementation of the proposed algorithm.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Can you provide more information about the ratings and confidences of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 rated the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold with a confidence level of 3. Reviewer 2 also rated the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold with a confidence level of 4. Reviewer 3 also rated the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold with a confidence level of 3.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Given the concerns raised by the reviewers, particularly Reviewer 2's comment about the lack of experiments on computer vision or natural language processing applications, and the fact that all three reviewers have rated the paper as marginally above the acceptance threshold, I am inclined to reject the paper. However, Reviewer 1's concerns could be addressed with some further explanation from the authors. What do you suggest?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviewers' comments and ratings, it is clear that the paper has some issues that need to be addressed. It would be appropriate to ask the authors to provide a more detailed explanation of Equation 5 and the sensitivity of the performance with respect to the hyperparameter $\lambda$. Additionally, the authors could address Reviewer 2's concern by including experiments on computer vision or natural language processing applications. The concerns raised by Reviewer 3 about the training stability and appropriate implementation of the proposed algorithm should also be addressed. Once the authors have addressed these issues, the paper could be re-reviewed.
