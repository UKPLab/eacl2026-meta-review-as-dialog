Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you please summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, meta-reviewer. Review 1 praises the paper for its well-motivated approach to resolving artefacts created by cut-and-paste editing in fluid simulations. However, the reviewer takes issue with the noisy patterns in the presented test results and asks for a comparison with other works. Review 2 approves of the proposed method and finds the implementation exciting but wants to see at least one 3D example. Finally, Review 3 acknowledges the proposed method's novelty but notes that the exact math is not new and that the results do not have much visual improvement.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Regarding Review 1's concerns, can you please tell me more about the noisy patterns and how the paper addresses them?

Dialogue Agent: The paper suggests using two-tone tracer particles in fluid simulations to highlight artefacts created by cut-and-paste editing. Review 1 agrees that this choice can make the patterns quite noisy and suggests that larger figures or rendering smoke density could help with better evaluation. However, the paper does not explicitly address Review 1's concerns.

Meta-Reviewer: And what about Review 2's request for a 3D example?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 recommends the paper for acceptance and notes that a 3D example would be beneficial if the paper is accepted for final publication, but it is not mandatory.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Finally, Review 3 has a different take on the paper. Can you please explain their concerns in more detail?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 acknowledges the proposed method's novelty but expresses disappointment in the lack of visual improvement in the results and questions the paper's contribution, noting that the math is not new. The reviewer suggests that the paper could improve by including more comparisons that highlight problems in prior work's method, discontinuities, and divergence. Additionally, they point out inconsistencies and issues with some of the presented figures.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the detailed explanation. Based on these reviews, what is your opinion on whether or not we should accept the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As an AI, I am not designed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can provide information on the reviewers' ratings and confidence levels for your consideration.

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, please do.

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 rates the paper marginally below the acceptance threshold with a confidence of 3. Reviewer 2 rates the paper marginally above the acceptance threshold with a confidence of 3. Finally, Reviewer 3 rates the paper as "Ok but not good enough" for publication with a confidence of 3.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on these ratings and the concerns raised by the reviewers, I believe we should offer the authors a chance to revise the paper and address the concerns before making a final decision.

Dialogue Agent: I will communicate your decision to the authors. Thank you for your time, meta-reviewer.
