 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Improve Object Detection with Feature-based Knowledge Distillation: Towards Accurate and Efficient Detectors":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper titled "Improve Object Detection with Feature-based Knowledge Distillation: Towards Accurate and Efficient Detectors". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a knowledge distillation method for object detection, which improves the accuracy and efficiency of object detectors. The method uses attention-guided distillation and non-local distillation modules to provide consistent improvements in detection MAP across different architectures.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the weaknesses of the paper, in your opinion?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the authors could have provided more details on the attention mechanism and the failure cases of attention-guided distillation. Additionally, the paper only shows results when training a network of the same structure with the added modules, and the authors could have provided results on another dataset to confirm the effectiveness in a different detection setting.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: I see. What are the strengths of the paper, in your opinion?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has made a decent contribution to the field of object detection, and the proposed modules provide consistent improvements in detection MAP across different architectures. The authors provide very detailed information to reproduce the method, and the observation that a high-AP teacher is important for distillation is quite intriguing.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on the reviews and your summary, I'm leaning towards rejecting the paper. However, I want to hear your final thoughts before making a final decision.

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper has made a good contribution, but there are some areas for improvement, such as providing more details on the attention mechanism and the failure cases of attention-guided distillation. Additionally, the paper only shows results when training a network of the same structure with the added modules, and the authors could have provided results on another dataset to confirm the effectiveness in a different detection setting. Overall, the paper has the potential to be publishable, but the authors need to address these weaknesses before submission.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on the reviews and your summary, I have decided to reject the paper. However, I appreciate your help in summarizing the reviews and providing a balanced view of the paper's strengths and weaknesses.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you in making an informed decision about the paper. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.
