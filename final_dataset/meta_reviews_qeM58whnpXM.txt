Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "Its COMPASlicated: The Messy Relationship between RAI Datasets and Algorithmic Fairness Benchmarks" and I have a few questions before making a decision.

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I'm here to answer your questions to the best of my ability.

Meta-reviewer: Great. My first question is about the weaknesses identified in Review 1. Can you tell me more about the lack of integration or synthesis of technical ideas and results in the paper?

Dialogue agent: According to Review 1, the paper lists technical ideas and results without connecting them to the rest of the paper, which makes it harder to understand the intended conclusions. The reviewer suggests that providing more insight into how these results solve the introduced problems or how they could be used would be a significant contribution, as this paper aims to do bridging work between different fields.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, that makes sense. What about the strengths of the paper identified in Review 2?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 commends the paper for providing a comprehensive analysis of the potential issues that arise when using RAI datasets, particularly in testing new methods. The reviewer emphasizes that the intersectionality between different fields, such as criminal justice, psychology, and computer science, is valuable, and that the insights can create an increased awareness of potential ethical issues. Additionally, the paper raises interesting questions about the usage of real-world benchmarking data that comes from socio-technical systems.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. And finally, Review 3 suggests that the paper would benefit from an empirical analysis or value-based, methodological analysis of the pitfalls of the COMPAS dataset. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue agent: According to Review 3, the paper is lacking an audit of the COMPAS dataset, which is the most representative of the widely used CJ datasets. The reviewer suggests that a table or section summarizing the data distribution, the features, and how they were defined by domain experts versus how they are misinterpreted by computer scientists without domain knowledge would significantly strengthen the paper and make it more in line with the goals of the Datasets and Benchmarks Track.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, I am leaning towards accepting the paper. However, given the different opinions and the reviewer confidence levels, I am not yet entirely certain. Can you provide any additional information that could help me make a decision?

Dialogue agent: Based solely on these reviews, the paper appears to have several strengths and contributions, but also several weaknesses that could be addressed with further integration of technical ideas or a more detailed audit of the COMPAS dataset. However, ultimately it is up to your discretion as the meta-reviewer to decide whether the strengths outweigh the weaknesses and whether the paper is a good fit for the conference.
