Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I'm going to review a paper titled "SAGDA: Achieving $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ Communication Complexity in Federated Min-Max Learning." Can you tell me a bit about the reviews for this paper?

Dialogue agent: Sure. According to the reviews, the paper proposes a variance reduction algorithm for federated min-max optimization that achieves best possible convergence and communication under standard assumptions while handling arbitrary client heterogeneity. The proposed algorithm, SAGDA, improves upon existing rates and matches that of federated convex optimization, obtaining linear speedup in the number of workers. The paper also presents empirical results that validate the theoretical rates and show that SAGDA outperforms existing methods.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds impressive. What are the major strengths and weaknesses mentioned in the reviews?

Dialogue agent: The major strengths mentioned in the reviews are the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of SAGDA, as well as its ability to handle arbitrary client heterogeneity. The major weaknesses mentioned in the reviews are that the presentation of results and their discussion could be improved and that the paper could benefit from a comparison to SCAFFOLD, an extension to min-max optimization. Additionally, it would have been interesting to see if SAGDA achieves optimal $\kappa$-dependence and to conduct some toy experiments on deep learning tasks.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What are the minor issues that were mentioned?

Dialogue agent: The minor issues mentioned in the reviews are the need to highlight the key ideas in the convergence proof that allowed improvements over previous analyses, the need to extend the paper to different classes of non-convex objectives, and some typos and issues with the presentation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Now, what are the ratings and confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: The first reviewer rated the paper a 6 (weak accept) and had a confidence level of 3 (fairly confident). The second reviewer also rated the paper a 6 (weak accept) and had a confidence level of 3. The third reviewer also rated the paper a 6 (weak accept) but had a lower confidence level of 2 (willing to defend the assessment, but may not fully understand the central parts of the submission or the related work).

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. I'll take these into consideration as I decide whether to accept or reject the paper.
