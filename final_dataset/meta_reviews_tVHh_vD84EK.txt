Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have gone through the reviews for the paper "AutoST: Towards the Universal Modeling of Spatio-temporal Sequences". Review 1 points out that the technical novelty and contribution of the paper is not significant enough, and the paper fails to provide a fair comparison of the proposed UniST with other baseline methods. Review 2, on the other hand, finds the paper to be well-written, with clear explanations and extensive experiments. Review 3 appreciates the idea of the paper but raises concerns about the experiments focusing on only traffic datasets and the complexity of the AutoST1 and AutoST2 algorithms.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for the summary. I understand your concerns. Is there anything you would like me to clarify?

Meta-reviewer: Yes. I would like to know if the paper uses a fair comparison between UniST and other baseline methods, as pointed out in Review 1.

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that the paper provides clear ablation studies that show the performance difference of the three modeling types on different datasets and temporal setups, and compares the effectiveness of introducing automated architecture search to fuse the three types of modeling layers. 

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. Review 3 raises concerns about the experiments focusing on only traffic datasets. Can you let me know if the paper provides a rationale for choosing traffic datasets?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, the paper mentions that traffic forecasting is an important real-world application of spatio-temporal forecasting and that the proposed method has been tested on five traffic forecasting datasets. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods significantly.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Review 3 also raises concerns about the complexity of the AutoST1 and AutoST2 algorithms. Does the paper address this concern?

Dialogue Agent: The paper provides a detailed explanation of the AutoST1 and AutoST2 algorithms and the layer candidate set, which is formed by three types of layer, namely, T2S Layer, S2T Layer, and STS Layer. However, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the complexity of the algorithms.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I am concerned about the confidence levels of the reviewers. Review 1 has a confidence level of 3, while Review 2 has a confidence level of 3 as well. Review 3 has a confidence level of 4. Can you provide any insights into this?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can inform you that confidence levels reflect the degree of certainty that a reviewer has in their assessment. A higher confidence level indicates a higher degree of certainty.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I have decided to accept the paper with minor revisions. The labeling of Table 1 needs to be more detailed, and the rationale for the Adaptive Diffusion Convolution needs to be explained. I would also like the authors to review and address the concerns raised in Review 3 regarding the complexity of the AutoST1 and AutoST2 algorithms, and the rationale for choosing traffic datasets. 

Dialogue Agent: Understood. I will inform the authors of the revisions. Thank you for your time.
