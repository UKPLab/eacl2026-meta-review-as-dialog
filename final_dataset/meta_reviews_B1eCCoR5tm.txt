 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Pseudosaccades: A Simple Ensemble Scheme for Improving Classification Performance of Deep Nets":

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper titled "Pseudosaccades: A Simple Ensemble Scheme for Improving Classification Performance of Deep Nets". Can you help me understand the main contributions of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a data augmentation technique called "pseudosaccades" that improves the classification performance of deep neural networks. The authors ensemble multiple "pseudosaccades" using the same network, and show that this technique can achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting! But I'm not sure if the paper offers any new insights. Can you tell me more about the "pseudosaccades" technique and how it differs from other data augmentation methods?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The "pseudosaccades" technique involves sub-sampling the input image by randomly sampling rows and columns without replacement. This creates a new type of data augmentation that the authors call "ensemble of pseudosaccades". The technique is different from other data augmentation methods such as affine transformations, which the authors note have been widely used in the literature.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. But I'm not convinced that this technique is novel enough to be accepted in ICLR. Can you tell me more about the validation accuracy of the ResNet model used in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The validation accuracy of the ResNet model used in the paper is reported to be lower than the accuracy reported in the original ResNet paper. However, the authors note that this discrepancy may be due to differences in experimental setup and data preprocessing.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: That's a concern. Can you tell me more about the practical value of this work? Would it be more effective to train multiple models and ensemble them, rather than using the "pseudosaccades" technique?

Dialogue Agent: The authors note that the "pseudosaccades" technique can be seen as a form of regularization, and that it can be combined with other data augmentation techniques such as affine transformations. However, they do not compare the performance of their technique with other ensemble methods.

Turn 5:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. Based on the reviews, I think the paper does not offer enough novelty or technical contribution to be accepted in ICLR. What is your confidence rating for this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate this paper as "Ok but not good enough - rejection" with a confidence rating of 4. The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.
