DM: Hello. Can you tell me your thoughts on the topic: More Clicks, Fewer Bricks: The Lecture Hall Is Obsolete?

DA: Sure. What would you like to know?

DM: Well, I'm not quite sure which side to take. Can you provide me with some arguments for the "For" and "Against" sides?

DA: Of course. Let me first provide you with the arguments for the "For" side. One argument is that online courses can reach a larger audience, as evidenced by one MIT course that had 155,000 people sign up for it. This is a significant number of people who would not have had the opportunity to take the course otherwise.

DM: That's impressive. And what about the "Against" side?

DA: One argument is that the lecture hall experience provides valuable interaction and personal connection between students and professors. One professor who has been teaching at the same institution since 1960 noted that he has seen many changes, but believes that the personal interaction between students and professors is crucial.

DM: Hmm, I see. Is there any other argument that the "For" side provides?

DA: Yes, another argument is that online courses can be more interactive and engaging than traditional lectures. Online courses can incorporate multimedia components, interactive activities, and discussion forums to enhance the learning experience.

DM: That's a good point. And what about the "Against" side? Is there another argument?

DA: Yes, another argument is that the expertise and status of a physical institution can carry weight in the workforce. Employers may prefer graduates from well-established, reputable universities over online institutions.

DM: I see. So, based on these arguments, what would you say is the better option?

DA: I cannot provide an opinion or make a decision. My job is to present the arguments from both sides accurately and neutrally. Ultimately, it is up to you to weigh the arguments and form your own conclusion.
