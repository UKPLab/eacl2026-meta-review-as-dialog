Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, Dialogue Agent, for joining me today to discuss the reviews for the paper SoteriaFL. Can you tell me a bit more about the paper type, as that seems relevant to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, the paper is classified as long, which means it is expected to have a significant impact on the field and have thorough evaluation, resources, and reproducibility.

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful context. Let's dive into the reviews. Reviewer 1 had mostly positive things to say but suggested adding more numerical analysis and discussing limitations. What is your response to that?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but I can say that the paper does include theoretical and mathematical rigor to support their framework. In terms of discussing limitations, the authors could have addressed this more directly in the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that response. Moving on to Reviewer 2, they had some concerns over the lack of simulations and real-world use cases. What can you tell me about that?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2 identifies a potential limitation in that the authors do not put enough context around the necessity of the framework or provide examples of real-world use cases. However, as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions on their concerns.

Meta-Reviewer: I understand. Finally, Reviewer 3 had some hesitations about the practical significance of the paper and the lack of clarity on certain points. Can you elaborate on that?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3 questions the practical significance of the paper and suggests that experiments or comparisons to existing schemes could better illustrate the utility of the proposed framework. Additionally, they note certain points in the paper that could be clearer, such as what the "databases" are and what it means for them to be "neighbors." However, as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions on the validity of their concerns.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses, Dialogue Agent. Based on these reviews, I am leaning towards accepting the paper, but I need to weigh the concerns raised by the reviewers against the strengths of the paper. Overall, it seems like an innovative and technically sound contribution to the field of federated learning.
