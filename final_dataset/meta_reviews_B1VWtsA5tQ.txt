Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am here to discuss the reviews of the paper titled PPO-CMA with you.

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I am here to answer any questions you may have.

Meta-reviewer: Let's start with Review 1. The reviewer seems knowledgeable about the topic and has some critical comments on the proposed method. How confident do you think the reviewer is in their evaluation of the paper?

Dialogue agent: The reviewer has given a rating of 4 and expressed confidence level of 4. This means that the reviewer is fairly confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Moving on to Review 2, the reviewer gives high praise to the paper and seems to have a good understanding of the proposed method. However, they also mention some weaknesses in the experiments. What was their confidence level in the evaluation?

Dialogue agent: The reviewer has given a rating of 9 but expressed a lower confidence level of 3. This means that the reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct.

Meta-reviewer: Finally, Review 3 seems to take issue with the organization of the paper and questions the novelty of the proposed method. Given their lower confidence level, how should we weigh their evaluation?

Dialogue agent: The reviewer has given a rating of 4 and expressed a low confidence level of 2. This means that the reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the thorough responses. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to reject the paper. While Review 2 is very positive, I have concerns about the critical comments in Review 1 and the organizational issues mentioned in Review 3. Do you have any additional insights or comments to add?

Dialogue agent: As I am not permitted to provide opinions or recommendations, I will refrain from doing so. However, I am available to provide any further clarifications or answer any questions you may have.
