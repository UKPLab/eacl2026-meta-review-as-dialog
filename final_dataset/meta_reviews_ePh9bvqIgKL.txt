Meta-reviewer: Thanks for joining me, dialogue agent. I'm trying to make a decision regarding this paper on Discovering Parametric Activation Functions. Can you provide me with some insights into the reviews that were provided?

Dialogue Agent: Of course, I'm happy to help. There were three reviews provided for this paper. Review 1 gave a rating of 5 (marginally below acceptance threshold) and highlighted several strengths and weaknesses of the paper, including the need for further experimentation and the importance of establishing a proper baseline for comparison. Review 2 also gave a rating of 5 (marginally below acceptance threshold) and pointed out the importance of comparing the proposed method against learnable activation functions. Review 3 gave a rating of 6 (marginally above acceptance threshold) and praised the paper's empirical evaluation while also suggesting the authors be more explicit about the novelty of their contributions.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that summary. It seems like there are a few concerns regarding the paper. Based on the reviews, would you say that the paper is likely to be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue Agent: It's difficult to say for certain, but it seems like the paper is on the border of acceptance. Reviewers praised the paper's strengths, but pointed out some areas for improvement, particularly in terms of experimentation and comparison to existing methods.

Meta-reviewer: I see. One thing that stands out to me is Review 1's comment regarding the confidence level of the reviewer's evaluation. They rated the paper a 5 with high confidence. Would you say that this is a significant factor in the decision-making process?

Dialogue Agent: It's important to consider the confidence level of the reviewer when making a decision, but it's not the only factor. Ultimately, the decision should be based on a thorough evaluation of the paper, taking into account all of the reviewers' comments and the paper's strengths and weaknesses.

Meta-reviewer: That's a good point. Thank you for your help. I think I'll take some time to carefully consider the reviews before making a decision.
