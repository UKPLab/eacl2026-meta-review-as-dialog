Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I'm reviewing a long paper titled 'ProxQuant: Quantized Neural Networks via Proximal Operators'. Could you provide me with some general information about the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I can provide information about the reviews. The paper received three reviews. Review 1 rated the paper with a score of 8, placing it in the top 50% of accepted papers, with a confidence of 4. Review 2 rated the paper with a score of 7 and expressed some concerns about novelty and fairness of experiments, also with a confidence of 4. Review 3 rated the paper with a score of 5 and expressed concerns about the novelty of the paper and suggested additional experiments, also with a confidence of 4.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Review 1 seems very positive, but can you tell me more about the concerns raised in reviews 2 and 3?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, certainly. Review 2 had some concerns regarding the novelty of the paper and the fairness of experiments. The reviewer suggested that the proposed ProxQuant is similar to BinaryRelax, except for non-lazy versus lazy updates, and would like more explanation about why it outperforms BinaryRelax and BinaryConnect in practice. Review 2 also suggested additional experiments with ImageNet and exploring different values for the regularization parameter lambda_t. Review 3 was also concerned with the novelty of the paper, arguing that the proposed method does not contribute to the existing literature, and suggested additional experiments with ImageNet.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. So, both reviews 2 and 3 raised concerns about the novelty of the paper. Can you tell me more about the concerns about fairness of experiments raised in review 2?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 raised concerns about the fairness of the experiments, particularly regarding the addition of more hyperparameters, such as the regularizer parameter lambda and the epoch to perform hard quantization. The reviewer has doubts about the fairness of comparing the proposed method to BinaryConnect, as BinaryConnect does not have this parameter. Review 2 also suggested that ProxQuant is fine-tuned based on pre-trained real-value weights, whereas it is unclear if BinaryConnect is also fine-tuned.

Meta-Reviewer: Okay, that's helpful. Can you summarize the main contributions and findings of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The main contribution of the paper is the proposal of ProxQuant, a new approach for learning quantized deep neural networks that overcomes the drawbacks of previous methods. The paper introduces quantization-encouraging regularization and derives the corresponding proximity operators. Based on this core, the rest of the approach is based on stochastic proximal gradient descent with a homotopy scheme. The paper shows that ProxQuant contributes to the state-of-the-art of this class of methods, providing clear evidence that it doesn't suffer from the drawbacks of straight-through gradient. The paper also provides a theoretical analysis of ProxQuant and its convergence properties. The experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms BinaryConnect and BinaryRelax in both theory and practice.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that summary. Based on the reviews, I'm still unsure about the novelty and fairness of the experiments. However, given that Review 1 seems to be very positive and Review 2 raised some valid concerns, I'm inclined to trust Review 2's rating. Since the proposed method has a good theoretical foundation and outperforms other methods in practice, I've decided to accept the paper despite the concerns raised by Review 2 and Review 3.
