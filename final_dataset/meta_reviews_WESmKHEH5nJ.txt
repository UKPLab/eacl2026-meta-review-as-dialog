Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the paper titled "Fast Stochastic Composite Minimization and an Accelerated Frank-Wolfe Algorithm under Parallelization" and would like to discuss the reviews with you before making a decision on acceptance or rejection.

Dialogue agent: Sure, I'm happy to help. What would you like to know?

Meta-reviewer: Well, the first review I received is quite critical of the paper. It mentions that the paper is difficult to parse and that the presentation of the parallelized algorithm has the flavor of being dishonest. The reviewer also states that the experiments are far away from the theory. Do you have any comments on this?

Dialogue agent: I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but it is important to note that the reviewer gave a rating of 3 and recommended rejection. According to our guidelines, a rating of 3 means that the paper has technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility, and incompletely addressed ethical considerations. However, the confidence level is 4, which means that the reviewer is confident in their assessment but not absolutely certain.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for clarifying. The second review is much more positive and mentions that the paper presents a solid contribution with good-to-excellent evaluation. The reviewer also states that the result is of interest to the community. However, the reviewer does bring up some limitations of the technique. What are your thoughts on this?

Dialogue agent: Again, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, but it may be helpful to consider the rating given by the reviewer, which is also a 7 for acceptance. According to our guidelines, a rating of 7 means that the paper is a technically solid paper with high impact on at least one sub-area, or moderate-to-high impact on more than one area, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations. The confidence level is also 3, which means that the reviewer is fairly confident in their assessment but may not have carefully checked all the math and details.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on the reviews, I am still unsure about whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you provide any additional information that may help me make a decision?

Dialogue agent: I can provide some information about the paper type and reviewer confidence levels. Based on the reviews, the paper type is long and the confidence levels range from 3 to 4. This suggests that the reviewers have a moderate to fairly high level of confidence in their assessments, but may not be absolutely certain. Ultimately, the decision is up to you as the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in making a final decision.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help. After considering the reviews and additional information, I have decided to accept the paper. While there were some limitations mentioned by the reviewers, the contributions and evaluation were solid and of interest to the community.
