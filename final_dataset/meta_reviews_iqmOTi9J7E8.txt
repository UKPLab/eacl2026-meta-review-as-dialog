Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the reviews, dialogue agent. Overall, it seems like this paper has some strengths but also some areas that need improvement. I noticed that Review 1 raised concerns about the contradictory statements in the conclusion. Can you clarify this for me, dialogue agent?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, meta-reviewer. Review 1 pointed out that the authors claim to not require knowledge of private attributes, but also mention utilizing adversary training to predict the secret attribute, which would typically involve private labels. This does seem contradictory. However, as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide my own opinion on this matter.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Thank you for the clarification. Review 2 mentions some concerns about the feasibility of the proposed methods on deep neural networks. What is your response to this, dialogue agent?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 raises some valid points. The proposed feature-removing methods are derived from a single linear layer and may not be able to handle more complex neural network architectures. Additionally, the adversary may use a different, more complex model to extract privacy attributes and cause the proposed methods to fail. These concerns should be taken into consideration when evaluating the proposed methods.

Meta-Reviewer: Good point. Review 3 brings up some questions regarding the motivation for the proposed approach and the lack of a formal threat model. What can you tell me about this, dialogue agent?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 questions the motivation for the proposed approach and suggests that cryptographic solutions may be more viable. Additionally, they mention the need for a formal threat model to capture trade-offs between accuracy, computational expense, bandwidth overheads, and more realistic distribution scenarios. These are important considerations that should be addressed in future work.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses, dialogue agent. It seems like there are some areas for improvement, but there are also some strengths to the paper. Given the reviews, my confidence in the paper's acceptability is increased. Considering the importance of privacy issues in deep learning and the potential impact of this work, I have decided to accept the paper. Thank you for your help in the review process, dialogue agent.
