 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Transferring Textual Knowledge for Visual Recognition":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Transferring Textual Knowledge for Visual Recognition". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new paradigm for transferring knowledge from pre-trained vision-language models to other downstream tasks, specifically visual recognition. The authors introduce a method of transferring textual knowledge into the standard recognition framework in a fixed-classifier fashion without additional training cost.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper demonstrates good accuracy with only a few epochs and performs well in few-shot/zero-shot scenarios. It also achieves 87+% on Kinetics400 using only publicly available pre-trained models, indicating that it is reproducible and can inspire future works. Additionally, the authors propose a simple yet effective paradigm for visual recognition, which could have a significant impact on the field.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: What are the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors may have included more discussion about the computational cost and efficiency issues. Additionally, the study only provides qualitative results for few-shot video recognition, and the authors may have included more details about the training details for this task. Finally, the authors may have explored failure cases to help readers understand the limitations of the work.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews, I'm leaning towards accepting the paper. However, I have some concerns about the weaknesses mentioned in the reviews. Can you help me understand how the authors address these issues?

Dialogue Agent: The authors address the computational cost and efficiency issues by proposing a simple yet effective paradigm for visual recognition. They also provide qualitative results for few-shot video recognition and suggest avenues for future work. Additionally, the authors acknowledge the limitations of the work and suggest possible directions for future research.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Based on the dialogue, I have decided to accept the paper with a rating of 7. The paper presents a technically solid and impactful contribution to the field, with good evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your decision. I'm glad I could help you understand the paper and its contributions. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.
