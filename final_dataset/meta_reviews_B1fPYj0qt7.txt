 Sure! Here is a dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Descent for Tensor-Train Recurrent Neural Networks". Can you help me assess its acceptability?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! I'll summarize the reviews and provide answers based on the information provided. The first review states that the novelty of the paper is limited, and the authors should tone down their claims. The reviewer also mentions that the paper misses an important reference. What would you like to know?

Meta-Reviewer: I would like to know more about the reference that was missed and how the authors could have improved their novelty claims.

Dialogue Agent: The review mentions that the paper misses the reference by Steinlechner et al. (2014) and Luong et al. (2015), which discuss low-rank tensor trains. The authors could have benefited from including these references in their work. Additionally, the review suggests that the authors should tone down their claims about the novelty of their paper, as it is not entirely original.

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful to know. What about the mathematical errors in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The second review mentions several mathematical errors, including issues with the definition of the tensor train decomposition, the use of the manifold of low-rank tensors, and the lack of baselines for the proposed method. The reviewer also suggests that the authors should provide more details on how to compute the projected gradient and the complexity of the projection.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the experimental issues?

Dialogue Agent: The third review mentions that the experimental section is lacking in several aspects. There are no baselines for the proposed method, and the convergence plots are only shown in iteration, making it difficult to assess the overhead of the Riemannian machinery. The reviewer also suggests that the authors should include ablation studies to assess the benefits of using Riemannian optimization and rank adaptation.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the information provided, I would rate the paper as "reject" with a confidence of 4. The novelty of the paper is limited, and the authors should have included more baselines and experimental details to assess the effectiveness of their proposed method. Additionally, the mathematical errors and lack of clarity in the paper are concerning.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback. I will make sure to provide more detailed summaries in the future. If you have any further questions or need assistance with other papers, please don't hesitate to ask.
