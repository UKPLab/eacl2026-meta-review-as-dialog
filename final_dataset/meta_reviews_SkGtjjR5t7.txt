Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have a paper titled "Learning to Drive by Observing the Best and Synthesizing the Worst" that has received three reviews. Could you provide me with a summary of the paper's main idea?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper proposes a framework for training a self-driving policy using imitation loss augmented with additional loss terms to discourage undesired behaviors and encourage progress. The policy takes as input a parsed representation of the scene and outputs pose trajectories for a downstream controller. The method is trained on simulated data including perturbations to improve generalizability and is evaluated through a series of ablations to better understand the contribution of the different loss terms.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that summary. Reviewer 1 expressed concerns about the limitation of producing paths using this framework and the lack of explicit reasoning over route feasibility. The reviewer also noted that the experiments were conducted on trivially small images. Could you address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1's concerns are valid and should be considered when weighing the paper's contributions. However, my role is to provide information, not opinions or recommendations. I can clarify that the paper focuses on a specific domain, self-driving, and the extent to which it provides insights for other domains is not clear.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Reviewer 2 had concerns about the lack of explanation of several aspects of the work, such as the pixel sizes and time resolution, and the missing data on where the vehicle is positioned within the image. Additionally, the review argues that the paper was missing a comparison with other existing motion planners. Can you provide insight into these issues?

Dialogue Agent: While Reviewer 2's points are worth considering, it is not within my capability to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can note that the paper focuses on proposing a learning-based motion planner rather than comparing it to other existing motion planners. Furthermore, the paper utilizes a fixed-size bird's-eye view map as input rather than a raw image, with handcrafted features such as the status of traffic lights, route, and underlying roadmaps mapped onto it. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your response. Reviewer 3 praised the paper's impressive demonstrations in simulation and real-world experiments but also highlighted some concerns, such as the missing details on how the data was collected and how it can be collected during testing time. Lastly, there were no comparisons with other related works. What's your take on these points?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 3's concerns are worth considering. However, as the paper's focus is on the proposed learning-based motion planner, comparisons with other related works are not within the scope of this paper's contributions. Additionally, while the paper discusses the utilization of a labeled oracle-like map as input, there may be questions on how this data was collected and how it can be collected during testing time.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for providing the information. Can you remind me of each reviewer's rating and confidence?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 gave the paper a rating of 3, indicating clear rejection. The reviewer expressed concerns that the proposed framework is too specific to self-driving and lacks explicit reasoning over route feasibility. Reviewer 2 has given the paper a rating of 6, just above the acceptance threshold, despite concerns over the lack of explanation of several aspects of the work and the absence of comparison with other existing motion planners. Reviewer 3 has given the paper a rating of 5, marginally below the acceptance threshold, although impressed with the demonstrations in simulation and real-world experiments, with some concerns over missing data collection details and evaluation environment. The confidence of all reviewers is 4, indicating confidence but not absolute certainty in their evaluations.
