 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper about removing batch normalization from ResNets. Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a set of visualization tools named SPPs for better monitoring the key indicators, including Average Channel Squared Mean, Average Channel Variance, etc., of hidden activations. With SPPs in hand, they find two key failure modes at initialization in deep ResNets and then develop Normalizer-Free ResNets using Scaled Weight Standardization, achieving competitive performance on ResNet-288 and Efficient-Net.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. But I have some concerns about the paper. Can you address them?

Dialogue Agent: Of course! What are your concerns?

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Well, firstly, I think the paper could have compared its method with other removing batch normalization works. Secondly, I would have liked to see more accuracy comparisons with other works. Lastly, I'm not sure if the proposed method can be applied to other tasks beyond classification.

Dialogue Agent: I see your points. The paper does mention that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on ResNet-288 and Efficient-Net, but it could be useful to include more comparisons with other works. Additionally, the paper could have explored the applicability of the proposed method to other tasks.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: Hmm, I'm still not convinced. Can you address my concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors have addressed some of your concerns in the updated version of the paper. They have added more comparisons with other works and explored the applicability of the proposed method to other tasks. Additionally, they have provided more details on the computational resources required for training the proposed method.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Okay, I think I've seen enough. What's your rating and confidence level for accepting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the updated version of the paper and the reviews, I would rate the paper as 7: Good paper, accept, with a confidence level of 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct. The proposed method is not yet a drop-in replacement for BatchNorm in general, but it can be useful in specific circumstances, i.e., small batch-size training.
