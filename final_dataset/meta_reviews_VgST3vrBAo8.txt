Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer assigned to evaluate the paper "Near-Optimal Goal-Oriented Reinforcement Learning in Non-Stationary Environments." Can you provide me with a brief summary of the reviews and their ratings?

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. Sure, there are three reviews for this long paper. Review 1 rates it a 7 and recommends it for acceptance. Review 2 rates it a 6 and suggests a weak acceptance. Finally, Review 3 also rates it a 7 and recommends acceptance. 

Meta-reviewer: Thanks for the summary. Based on your analysis of the reviews, what can you say about the confidence levels of each reviewer?

Dialogue agent: Each reviewer has a confidence level of 4, which means they are confident but not absolutely certain in their assessment. They are unlikely to have misunderstood some parts of the submission or be unfamiliar with related work. 

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. After reviewing their comments, I see that Review 2 has some concerns about the paper's novelty in comparison to a previous work. Can you tell me more about that?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Review 2 mentioned that the paper extends the results of a previous work but did not explain the differences between the two models. However, they still rated the paper as technically solid with moderate-to-high impact and no major concerns.

Meta-reviewer: I see. That raises another question. What can you tell me about the type of the paper?

Dialogue agent: The paper is classified as "long," indicating that it contains research that is both novel and significant, with sound and extensive analysis and evaluation. 

Meta-reviewer: Thanks for that information. Based on the reviews and their ratings, how confident would you say I should be in making a decision about accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue agent: As the confidence level of each reviewer is 4, it is unlikely that they have misunderstood or missed significant aspects of the paper. Therefore, you can reasonably rely on their assessments in making your decision.
