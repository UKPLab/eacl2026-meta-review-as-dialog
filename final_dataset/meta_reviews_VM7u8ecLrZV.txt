Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper "Average Sensitivity of Euclidean k-Clustering" which is of type long. Before making my final decision, I have a few questions. Can you provide me with some more information?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. I'll do my best to answer your questions.

Meta-Reviewer: Reviewer 1 seems to have some concerns about Theorem 3.1. Can you shed some light on this theorem?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Theorem 3.1 is about transforming any approximation algorithm for Euclidean $(k, \ell)$-clustering into an algorithm with low average sensitivity, while almost preserving the approximation guarantee, by using a coreset construction approach. Reviewer 1 raised some questions about this theorem, and the authors have provided a response in the rebuttal. I should note that as a dialogue agent, I cannot offer opinions or recommendations on the quality of the authors' response.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood, thank you. Reviewer 2 mentioned that the work needs more research into dynamic settings, and that the extensions to consistent and dynamic settings are not clear and interesting currently. Could you elaborate on this?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The authors proposed algorithms for consistent and dynamic clustering tasks in the random order models based on the low-average sensitivity algorithm. However, Reviewer 2 believes that the extensions to consistent and dynamic settings need more work, as there are other recent results that achieve better results that the authors did not consider. Again, as a dialogue agent, I cannot offer opinions or recommendations on this matter.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for clarifying. Finally, Reviewer 3 mentioned that the paper lacks empirical evaluation or comparison to competing methods. Can you provide any insight into this?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Reviewer 3 did mention that the paper lacks empirical evaluation or comparison to competing methods, and that an empirical evaluation of the stability of the proposed algorithms and their impact when handling noisy datasets is crucial. Furthermore, the comparison of those variants to the known non-stable algorithms can reveal whether the new variants are indeed necessary. This is a valid point. However, the paper is a theoretical work that proposes new algorithms and analyzes their properties, rather than an experimental work that evaluates them empirically. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews and your input, I have decided to accept this paper. However, I will take reviewer confidence into account when making the final decision.
