Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. Thank you for being here with me today. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "Post Selection Inference with Incomplete Maximum Mean Discrepancy Estimator" and I would like to discuss them with you. 

Dialogue Agent: Of course, Meta-Reviewer. I am here to provide you with any information you need regarding the reviews.

Meta-Reviewer: Let's start with Review 1. The reviewer acknowledges that the proposed method for post selection inference (PSI) is important and addresses a problem that has not been previously tackled in literature. However, the reviewer finds it hard to judge the correctness of the proposed estimator since the main idea is not well-explained. Do you think this is a valid concern?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the review, it seems that the main idea of the proposed estimator could have been explained more clearly. However, as a dialogue agent, I am not able to provide opinions or recommendations about the validity of the reviewer's concerns.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Reviewer 1 also asks about how large the sample size needs to be to get an accurate enough covariance matrix for sub-sequent PSI. Do you have any insights on this matter, given the type of the paper, which is long?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion on this matter. However, the authors of the paper might have addressed this concern in their work as it seems like an important question to answer.

Meta-Reviewer: That's a good point. Moving on to Review 2, the reviewer finds the paper's combination of incomplete MMD and PSI technique straightforward but notes that it works due to the asymptotic Gaussian property of the incomplete MMD. The reviewer also suggests that a more exciting application can make the paper more interesting. What do you think of these points?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 2's opinion is noted, but as a dialogue agent, I am limited to providing additional information rather than opinions or recommendations. The idea of a more exciting application could indeed make the paper more interesting, and it might be an avenue that the authors could explore.

Meta-Reviewer: Agreed. Finally, in Review 3, the reviewer provides some suggestions to improve the manuscript. Based on your knowledge of the paper's type, which is long, do you believe any of these suggestions are crucial?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion on whether any of the suggested improvements are crucial. However, it is important to note that the reviewer found the submission to be a well-organized, clearly written, nice contribution, and it could be relevant to the machine learning community.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the confidence levels assigned by the reviewers, do you have any insights into the likelihood of acceptance of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 provided a rating of "Marginally above acceptance threshold," while Reviewer 2 rated the paper as "Marginally below acceptance threshold." Reviewer 3 rated the paper as "Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept." Therefore, the confidence levels of reviewers regarding the acceptance of the paper are varied.

Meta-Reviewer: That's true. I need to take this variability into account when making a decision. Thank you for your help, Dialogue Agent.

Dialogue Agent: It was my pleasure, Meta-Reviewer. I am always here to assist with any questions you may have.
