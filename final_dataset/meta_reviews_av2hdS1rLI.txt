Meta-reviewer: Hi, I have read the reviews for the paper titled $\alpha$-VAEs: Optimizing variational inference by learning data-dependent divergence skew and would like to discuss them with you.

Dialogue agent: Sure, I'm happy to answer any questions you may have.

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 has raised concerns about the validity of the optimization objective used in the paper. Can you shed some light on this?

Dialogue agent: The paper uses a divergence measure other than KL divergence in the optimization objective, which makes it no longer a valid lower bound on the marginal likelihood. However, the approach leads to better reconstruction loss as compared to traditional VAEs. The paper does not claim to provide a valid lower bound but rather investigates a new optimization approach.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Reviewer 1 also mentioned that the paper's evaluation is incorrect. What do you have to say about that?

Dialogue agent: The paper does not evaluate the marginal likelihood but focuses on reconstruction loss and rate-distortion tradeoff. The approach leads to improved performance in these metrics, as compared to traditional VAEs. However, the paper does not claim that the approach always outperforms the traditional VAE approach.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 2 has questioned the paper's fit in the workshop since it does not include anything on normalizing flows. Can you provide some clarification on this?

Dialogue agent: Although the paper does not focus on normalizing flows, it aligns with the workshop theme of approximate likelihood models. The proposed approach is an extension to traditional VAEs and aims to optimize the divergence measure in a data-dependent way.

Meta-reviewer: Reviewer 3 seems to have positive feedback regarding the paper's idea. Is there anything you would like to add to that?

Dialogue agent: We agree with the positive feedback and appreciate the reviewer's concerns. The proposed approach has implications for optimizing the VAE objective and improving the reconstruction loss and rate-distortion tradeoff. We would be happy to discuss any concerns that the reviewers have regarding the approach and the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews, I have decided to accept the paper with minor revisions.
