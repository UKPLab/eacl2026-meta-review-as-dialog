Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Unsupervised Emergence of Spatial Structure from Sensorimotor Prediction" and I am tasked with deciding whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you tell me more about the paper, its type, and the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The title of the paper is "Unsupervised Emergence of Spatial Structure from Sensorimotor Prediction" and the type of the paper is long. There are three reviews from the reviewers. Review 1 gave a rating of 4 and expressed concerns with the delivery and lack of clarity in some of the paper's premises. Reviewer 2 gave a rating of 6 and suggested extensive revisions to be made. Reviewer 3 gave a rating of 7 and thought the paper was good enough to be accepted, with some suggestions for improvements.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that summary. Can you tell me more about the concerns that Reviewer 1 expressed?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 expressed concerns with the writing being too verbose and vague without clarifying the details. They also suggested that the premise of comparing the embedding of motor commands and the agent's spatial configuration only works under a special condition that is not general. Additionally, they questioned the assumptions made in the paper about the environment moving between sensory observations and motor commands.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what were Reviewer 2's suggestions for revisions?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 suggested including references to two other papers and streamlining section 2 (related work) to be less critical of prior work. They also suggested clarifying the terminology and assumptions made in section 3 and including references to other works that use intrinsic curiosity in their architecture. Lastly, Reviewer 2 recommended presenting results on a nonlinear case, such as path integration in 2D from egocentric velocity.

Meta-reviewer: Very helpful. And finally, what were Reviewer 3's thoughts on the paper?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 3 thought that the paper was interesting and relevant for the representation learning community, but recommended extensive revisions to be made. They suggested presenting results beyond the 2D grid world environment and rewriting section 3 to be easier to follow for a wider audience. Reviewer 3 also recommended exploring other works that use intrinsic curiosity in their architecture and including references to them in the paper. Nonetheless, they thought the paper was "good enough to be accepted."
