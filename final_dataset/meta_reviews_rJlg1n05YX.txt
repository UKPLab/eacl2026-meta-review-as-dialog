 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Penetrating the Fog: the Path to Efficient CNN Models":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Penetrating the Fog: the Path to Efficient CNN Models". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new approach to reducing the kernel complexity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by using sparse kernel design. The authors claim that this approach can achieve better efficiency while maintaining accuracy.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. But I have some concerns about the paper's claims. Can you summarize the reviewer comments for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Reviewer 1 notes that the paper's claims are not well supported by the experiments, and that the concept of "information field" is not clearly explained. Reviewer 2 states that the paper's approach is not general enough and that the authors' claims about the importance of the "information field" are not substantiated. Reviewer 3 expresses confusion about the theorem presented in the paper and notes that the paper's reasoning and derivations are assuming a specific spatial area and tensor size.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviewer comments. I have similar concerns about the paper's claims and the concept of "information field". Can you tell me more about the authors' definition of "information field"?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors define "information field" as the product of the operator's (spatial) receptive field and the number of channels that each unit can see. They claim that this quantity is closely related to the model accuracy, but they do not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: I see. I think the authors need to provide more evidence to support their claims about the "information field". Can you tell me more about the experiments in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors only try four alternative sparse kernel designs in their experiments, and they do not provide enough variations to substantiate their claims about the importance of the "information field". Additionally, the authors do not provide enough details about the computation time and parameter efficiency of their proposed approach.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviewer comments and our conversation, I think the paper needs more evidence to support its claims and a more detailed explanation of the "information field" concept. I will likely reject the paper unless these issues are addressed.

Dialogue Agent: Understood. Thank you for your feedback. I will pass on your comments to the authors.
