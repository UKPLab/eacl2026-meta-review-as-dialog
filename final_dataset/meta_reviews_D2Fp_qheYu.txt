Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today to discuss the reviews for the paper "Max-sliced Bures Distance for Interpreting Discrepancies."

Dialogue agent: Of course, happy to be here.

Meta-reviewer: Let's start with Review 1. Overall, they vote for acceptance, but with some reservations about the experiments. They were hoping to see a more compelling demonstration of the technique on common problems in machine learning. Can you provide some insight into the experiments and their validity?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The experiments presented in the paper demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in detecting class imbalance, identifying data subsets in generative models, detecting covariate shift outlier detection, identifying covariate shift through reweighting on synthetic CIFAR-10, and distribution matching on toy distributions. The authors believe these applications to be novel and valuable contributions to the machine learning literature.

Meta-reviewer: But Review 1 seems to have some reservations about the experiments. Can you address those concerns?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 notes that some difficulty in interpreting the experiments and some doubts regarding their optimality are present. Specifically, they wanted to see a more compelling demonstration of the technique in solving mode-dropping, which is a common problem in machine learning. Additionally, they felt that the comparison with other methods where possible was weak in some cases.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. Let's move on to Review 2. They felt that the exposition of the paper makes it difficult to follow and identify the new results. They suggest that the paper needs to be restructured. Can you provide any insight into this?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 notes that while the paper proposes a sliced version of the Bures distance, it is presented in a broader context of integral probability metric (IPM) divergence on Hilbert spaces. They felt that the main contributions of the paper are contained in the appendix and should be streamlined into the main text. They also suggest that the introduction should be rewritten for more clear exposition of the contributions.

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 also had concerns about the theoretical basis for divergence on a Hilbert space. Do you have any thoughts on that?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 suggested that it wasn't immediately clear why a divergence on a Hilbert space was necessary, and that a clearer motivation for this choice would be helpful. While this wasn't directly addressed in the paper, the authors do note that this allows for better sample complexity and presents finite dimensional optimization problems.

Meta-reviewer: Finally, Review 3 notes that the paper lacks clarity and intuition, and that the experiments are unconvincing. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 notes that the paper heavily builds on recent work on sliced Wasserstein distances and OT on RKHS. They suggest that the exposition could be more clear and that some parts feel like overkill. Additionally, they suggest that the experiments are lacking in necessary quantitative comparisons and rely too heavily on qualitative evaluations.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on what you've told me, do you have any recommendations for acceptance or rejection?

Dialogue agent: While there are some concerns raised about the clarity and validity of the experimental results and the presentation of the paper overall, there does seem to be value in the proposed technique. As such, I would recommend acceptance with minor revisions, such as clarifying motivations and reorganizing the presentation of results.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Your input has been helpful in making my decision.
