Buyer: Hi, I am interested in the Sigma 10-20mm f/4-5.6 EX DC HSM Lens. Can you tell me more about it?

Dialogue agent: Certainly! What would you like to know?

Buyer: How is the image quality?

Dialogue agent: The reviews on this lens suggest that the image quality is pretty good, but it's a bit soft outside of center focus. However, pictures are sharp and the lens isn't quite "fisheye," which is great for what it's used for. 

Buyer: Does it have any noticeable distortion?

Dialogue agent: Some reviewers have mentioned that it produces distortion in the corners when set to 10mm. However, it can still take beautiful pictures, especially for landscape photography.

Buyer: How does it perform in low light?

Dialogue agent: The lens is fairly fast, but does not perform well in moderate to low light conditions. The aperture of f/4-5.6 on the narrow end is unfortunate, but this lens is not really intended for low light shooting.

Buyer: Is it suitable for both DX & FX cameras?

Dialogue agent: Yes, this lens is for Nikon DX & FX cameras but is somewhat limited on an FX camera such as the D3 or D700 because of the bigger sensor size that picks up the barrel of the lens. 

Buyer: Based on the reviews, would you recommend this lens?

Dialogue agent: As a neutral dialogue agent, I do not provide recommendations or opinions. However, I can tell you that this lens has received a lot of positive feedback and is considered to be a good value for its price. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide if this lens suits your needs.
