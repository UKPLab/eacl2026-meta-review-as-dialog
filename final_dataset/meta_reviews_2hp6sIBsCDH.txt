Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for being here. I've been looking over the reviews for the paper titled "Global Linear and Local Superlinear Convergence of IRLS for Non-Smooth Robust Regression." 

Dialogue Agent: It's my pleasure to assist you, meta-reviewer. Let me know how I can help.

Meta-Reviewer: Well, let's start with a general question. Can you tell me the type of paper this is?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the type of paper is long. 

Meta-Reviewer: Good. That's what I thought. Now, one of the reviewers (Review 1) commented on the lack of a novel algorithmic twist in the paper. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, it is true that the focus of the paper is on developing theory rather than introducing a novel algorithmic approach.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Another concern raised by Review 2 was the gap between the theoretical analysis and the numerical experiments. Can you expand on that?

Dialogue Agent: The authors showed that the theoretical results only hold under the assumption that the number of samples, m, is much larger than n and k. However, the experiments conducted by the authors showed that the algorithm performed well even when m was comparable to n and k. The reviewer suggested that there may be a gap between the theory and the experiments.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for clarifying that. Review 3 mentioned the difficulty in verifying the stable range space property condition in general. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer mentioned that although the stable range space condition is satisfied for Wigner matrices, it is not easy to verify in general. The condition requires checking all subsets of coordinates of size k. The reviewer suggested that it would be nice to have a condition that can be more easily verified in a general setting.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. It seems that there are both strengths and weaknesses to the paper, but overall the technical quality is solid. 

Dialogue Agent: That is correct, meta-reviewer. The ratings for all three reviews were Weak Accept: Technically solid, moderate-to-high impact paper, with no major concerns with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility, ethical considerations. 

Meta-Reviewer: That's good to hear. Now, can you tell me how confident you are in your assessment?

Dialogue Agent: My confidence level is 4, which means that I am confident in my assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that I did not understand some parts of the submission or that I am unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. You have been very helpful. Based on the three reviews and your responses, I have a better understanding of the paper and feel more confident in my decision-making process.
