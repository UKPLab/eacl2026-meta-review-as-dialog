Meta-reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I have read the three reviews on the paper titled "Logical Activation Functions: Logit-space equivalents of Probabilistic Boolean Operators" and I would like to discuss the decision to accept or reject the paper. What can you tell me about the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Hello, Meta-reviewer. Sure, I can summarize the main points of each review for you.

Meta-reviewer: Great, let's start with Review 1. What are the main strengths and weaknesses pointed out in this review?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 mentions that the paper presents a reasonably original idea and the proposed activation functions are explained clearly. However, the main weakness highlighted is the lack of sufficient motivation and significance for the proposed functions. The reviewer also points out that the experiments section presents an overly optimistic interpretation of the results and that some details are missing, such as the balancing of parameters across activation function choices.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what's the rating and confidence level of this review?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 has a rating of 6, which is a weak accept, and a confidence level of 4, meaning the reviewer is confident in their assessment but not absolutely certain.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, let's move on to Review 2. Can you summarize the main points of this review?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 considers the idea presented in the paper to be novel and interesting and finds the paper technically sound with a well-supported claim by theoretical analysis and experimental results. The reviewer also points out the thorough discussion of related works, the good organization of the paper, and the extensive experimentation on different types of tasks. However, one criticism is the need for a table to accompany some of the figures.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What is the rating and confidence level of Review 2?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 has a rating of 7, which is an accept, and a confidence level of 2, meaning the reviewer is willing to defend their assessment, but it's quite likely they did not understand the central parts of the submission or are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

Meta-reviewer: Alright. And what about Review 3?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 highlights the presentation of new activation functions based on relaxation of logical operators and the efficient approximations based on max, min, and addition operations. The reviewer finds this idea interesting and notes that the empirical evaluation demonstrates the activation functions behave well, even improving performance in some cases. The reviewer also appreciates the authors' approach of ensembling activation functions to avoid adding more parameters. However, the reviewer notes that the authors make independency assumptions, which could be a weakness.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what is the rating and confidence level of Review 3?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 has a rating of 7, which is an accept, and a confidence level of 4, meaning the reviewer is confident in their assessment, but not absolutely certain.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summaries, Dialogue Agent. Based on these reviews, what is your recommendation for accepting or rejecting this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, two out of three reviewers recommend accepting the paper, with one finding it a weak accept and the other rating it a strong accept. The reviewers appreciate the technical soundness, originality, and thorough experimentation of the paper. However, there are some concerns about the lack of motivation and significance in Review 1 and the need for a table in Review 2. Would you like me to provide more information or clarify anything?

Meta-reviewer: No, that's helpful. I think I will accept the paper, but I will ask the authors to address the concerns raised in the reviews.

Dialogue Agent: Understood, Meta-reviewer. I will relay your decision to the authors.
