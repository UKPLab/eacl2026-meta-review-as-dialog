 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Proximal Learning With Opponent-Learning Awareness":

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Proximal Learning With Opponent-Learning Awareness". Can you please provide a summary of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new algorithm called POLA, which is an extension of the LOLA algorithm. POLA uses a proximal update objective to improve the performance of LOLA in social dilemmas. The authors empirically demonstrate that POLA outperforms LOLA in certain environments.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The main contributions of the paper are the introduction of the proximal update objective and the demonstration of its effectiveness in improving the performance of LOLA. Additionally, the paper highlights the limitations of LOLA and provides a solution to mitigate those limitations.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the limitations of LOLA that the paper addresses?

Dialogue Agent: LOLA assumes specific agent parameterization and its updates depend on this parameterization. The paper shows that different parameterization can result in different equilibria. POLA mitigates this downside by shifting the opponent shaping from the parameter space to the policy space.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: I understand. What are the practical limitations of POLA?

Dialogue Agent: POLA is only applicable to 2-agent environments and requires access to environment model or transition dynamics. Additionally, the paper raises some minor concerns regarding the presentation and the need for more ablation experiments.

Turn 5:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on your summary, I would rate the paper as a 7, Accept: Technically solid paper with high impact on at least one sub-area, or moderate-to-high impact on more than one areas, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations. My confidence in the assessment is 5, I am absolutely certain about my assessment.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your feedback. I will use this information to assist in the final decision regarding the acceptance of the paper.
