Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for joining me today. Let's start by discussing your overall impression of the paper, "Latency-aware Spatial-wise Dynamic Networks." Based on the reviews, what are your thoughts on this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for having me. Based on the reviews, I can say that the paper is technically solid and demonstrates good results in reducing latency for image classification. Review 1 praises the paper for its relevance to dynamic inference and realistic speedup results. Review 2 also recognizes the strengths of the paper and provides some useful insights. However, it also highlights some weaknesses, such as limited generalization to other models and hardware platforms. Finally, Review 3 raises some concerns about the novelty of the proposed approach and some presentation issues but overall also describes the paper as technically solid and important.

Meta-Reviewer: It seems like there are some concerns raised in Review 2 and Review 3. Can you elaborate on the limitations of the proposed approach? And would you consider these limitations critical to the acceptance of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Review 2 raises a valid concern about the limited generalization of the proposed approach to other efficient models. Similarly, Review 3 points out the limited novelty of the paper and the unclear applicability of the proposed methodology to more dense computer vision tasks. These are certainly important limitations that should be clearly addressed in the paper. However, I wouldn't consider them critical to the acceptance of the paper since they only raise questions about the extent of the contributions. On the other hand, the paper is technically sound and the results are promising regarding the latency reduction of image classification. 

Meta-Reviewer: Speaking of technical soundness, Review 1 raises some concerns about the training recipes and the missing details. How do you think the authors can address these issues?

Dialogue Agent: These issues are indeed concerning and should be addressed by the authors. Specifically, the authors could provide more details such as learning rate scheduler and augmentations in the training recipe for a fair comparison with other works. Moreover, the authors should clarify how different convolution implementations, e.g., Winograd, will benefit from the proposed approach. The authors could also provide more details on the unclear sections to make it easier for reviewers to evaluate them. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for addressing these concerns. Finally, based on the reviews and your expertise, what is your overall recommendation regarding the acceptance of this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and my knowledge, I would recommend accepting this paper with a score of 6 or 7 out of 10, with the understanding that the authors should address the concerns raised by the reviewers. The paper presents a technically solid approach for reducing latency in image classification, and its relevance to dynamic inference and realistic speedup results make it an important contribution. However, the authors need to address some concerns about generalization, training recipes, and presentation.
