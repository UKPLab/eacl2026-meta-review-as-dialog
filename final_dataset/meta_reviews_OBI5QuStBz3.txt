Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you tell me about the main contribution of the paper and the problem it addresses?

Dialogue agent: The paper addresses the problem of optimizing a sum of strongly convex and strongly smooth functions in the distributed point-to-point communication setting. Its main contribution is providing deterministic and randomized lower-bounds on the communication bit complexity and a quantized-based algorithm with asymptotic matching upper-bounds.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What is the paper's main result?

Dialogue agent: The paper shows that for quadratic optimization, to obtain an additive epsilon approximation deterministically requires \Omega(Nd*log(beta*d/epsilon)) bits and the same for randomized approximation is \Omega(Nd*log(beta*d (N*epsilon))) bits, where beta is the smoothness parameter of \sum_i f_i. The generalization to N machines of the earlier works on the 2-node setting is a natural extension to this study.

Meta-reviewer: The first review seems to suggest that there are concerns about the paper's technical innovations. Can you comment on that?

Dialogue agent: I cannot provide an opinion on that as it is not within my capabilities as a dialogue agent. However, the paper does provide a novel connection between communication complexity and real-valued optimization-tasks, which may be of interest to the ICLR community.

Meta-reviewer: Another review mentions that the paper has a large number of typos and errors. Can you speak to that issue?

Dialogue agent: Yes, that is a fair concern. The paper could benefit from proof-reading and editing. However, the quality of writing does not impact the novelty of the paper's contribution.

Meta-reviewer: Given the reviews, what is your recommendation about accepting or rejecting this paper?

Dialogue agent: As all three reviews indicate that the paper is marginally above or below the acceptance threshold, I would recommend accepting the paper if there is room in the conference. However, if there are too many accepted papers already, the paper may not be accepted.
