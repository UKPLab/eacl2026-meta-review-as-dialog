 Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about the paper "Multi-modal Grouping Network for Weakly-Supervised Audio-Visual Video Parsing":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper called "Multi-modal Grouping Network for Weakly-Supervised Audio-Visual Video Parsing". Can you tell me a little bit about the paper and its main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new baseline architecture for video parsing, using learnable categorical embedding tokens and a class-aware unimodal grouping network. It also introduces a cross-modal grouping network to time-stamp audio, visual, and audio-visual events using only video-level labels. The proposed method has improved results compared to other baselines on the Look, Listen, and Parse dataset.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the limitations of the paper and the authors' suggestions for future work?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the authors mention that the paper is heavily inspired by recently proposed GroupViT for image segmentation, and that the proposed method if effective compared to other baselines as evident from the qualitative and quantitative results. However, the authors also outline the differences between their approach and GroupViT in the supplementary material.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: I see. What about the weakly-supervised aspect of the paper? How does the authors address the challenge of limited evaluation and possible solutions of semi-supervised training and incorporating more intermediate supervision?

Dialogue Agent: The authors point out that the model has limited data and worse performance with deeper network, and suggest possible solutions such as semi-supervised training and incorporating more intermediate supervision. They also mention the case of rare events in real deployment, which is practical and has corresponding techniques focusing on the case.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: That's good to know. Can you tell me more about the review process and the ratings you've given to the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Based on the reviews, I've given the paper a rating of 6: Weak Accept, with a confidence level of 4. The paper is technically solid, with moderate-to-high impact, and no major concerns with respect to evaluation, resources, reproducibility, or ethical considerations. However, the authors could have been more explicit in their discussion of the differences between their approach and GroupViT.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your help! I think I have a good understanding of the paper and its contributions now. Do you have any final thoughts or recommendations for me before I make my final decision?

Dialogue Agent: Just that the paper is well-written and easy to read through, and that the authors have made a valuable contribution to the field of video parsing. However, I would suggest that the authors provide more explicit explanations of their approach and how it differs from GroupViT, to help readers better understand the novelty and impact of their work.
