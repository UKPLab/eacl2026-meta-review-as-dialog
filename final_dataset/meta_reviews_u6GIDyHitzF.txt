Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you give me a summary of the paper's reviews?

Dialogue agent: Sure, the paper received three reviews. Reviewer 1 praised the algorithm's performance and few adaptive rounds, the organization of the paper, and its detailed background. However, the reviewer had some questions and concerns that were not fully addressed. Reviewer 2 appreciated the paper's organization and its discussion about the motivation of the problem, algorithm design, and the challenges, with evaluation using real-life datasets. The reviewer thought that a lower bound may strengthen the theoretical results and requested more explanation in the experiments setup. Reviewer 3 found the batched learning settings relevant to practical applications, appreciating the paper's well-written notation and the described learning algorithm with stronger theoretical guarantees than existing methods. However, the reviewer found some missing related literature and missing references, with experimental study leaves room for improvement.

Meta-reviewer: What is the type of the paper and its title?

Dialogue agent: The paper's type is long, and the title is "An Asymptotically Optimal Batched Algorithm for the Dueling Bandit Problem."

Meta-reviewer: What is the overall rating and confidence level of the paper?

Dialogue agent: The paper received a rating of 6, which is a weak acceptance by all three reviewers. The confidence level of Reviewer 1 and 2 are 3 and 4, respectively, which means they are fairly confident in their assessment. Reviewer 3's confidence level is also 4, which means they are confident in their assessment, but not absolutely certain.
