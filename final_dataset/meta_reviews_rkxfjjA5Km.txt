Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. I have read them carefully and have a few questions for clarification. Reviewer 1, you raised concerns about the assumption of mutual independence among $X$ given $Z$. Can you elaborate on when this assumption holds and fails? And regarding Reviewer 2's comment about the gap between theory and practice, how can we bridge this gap to ensure reliable use of the proposed procedure?

Dialogue agent: Regarding the assumption of mutual independence among $X$ given $Z$, we agree with Reviewer 1 that this assumption may not always hold. However, as we noted in the paper, this assumption is not specific to our approach and is an inherent assumption made in knockoff methods in general. As for the gap between theory and practice, we acknowledge the concern raised by Reviewer 3. While we cannot guarantee that the encoder and decoder models are appropriate in all cases, we can perform checks such as cross-validation and model selection to ensure that they are at least reasonable approximations of the conditional distributions. Additionally, we can provide guidelines for choosing hyperparameters and training the models to maximize the likelihood of satisfying the assumptions in Theorem 2.2, and we plan to further investigate this in future work.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Reviewer 2, you identified grammatical errors in the manuscript but also raised concerns about the correctness of the paper. Can you clarify whether the grammatical errors were significant enough to impact your evaluation of the paper?

Reviewer 2: While the grammatical errors were not significant enough to impact my evaluation of the paper, the concerns about the correctness of the paper were major and cannot be ignored. The incorrect proof in Contribution 1 undermines the entire paper, and the experimental results are suspicious. Therefore, I believe the paper should be rejected.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input, Reviewer 2. Based on the overall feedback and concerns raised, I believe that the paper should be rejected. While there are promising aspects to the proposed approach, the major concerns about the correctness of the paper and the gap between theory and practice cannot be ignored. Additionally, the presentation of the paper could be improved to address the confusion about notation and lack of detail in the main results. Therefore, I will recommend a clear rejection to the authors.
