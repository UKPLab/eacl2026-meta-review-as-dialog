Meta-reviewer: Thank you for submitting your paper "Adversarial representation learning for synthetic replacement of private attributes". I have reviewed the three reviews, and I have some questions and concerns that I would like to discuss further with you before making a decision. 

Dialogue agent: Thank you for considering our paper. I am ready to answer your questions and address your concerns.

Meta-reviewer: The first review asks if you can provide more evidence as to why replacing the sensitive information with synthetic data is useful. Is replacing the sensitive attribute with a random value enhancing privacy, or is this just an assumption?

Dialogue agent: Our proposed method provides privacy for image data without affecting their utility. The “filter” removes the sensitive attribute from the data representation, and the “generator” replaces the removed sensitive attribute with synthetic data. Our experiments on real image data show that replacing the sensitive attribute with synthetic data enhances privacy without affecting the utility. 

Meta-reviewer: The first review also asks why, in some cases, when epsilon is increased, both privacy loss and utility score gets better. Can you explain this?

Dialogue agent: Privacy loss and utility score can both improve when epsilon is increased because they are competing goals. When epsilon is small, privacy loss is low, and utility score is high. However, when epsilon is increased, privacy loss increases, but utility score may also improve due to the increase in the synthetic data's diversity. 

Meta-reviewer: The second review mentions that the proposed approach feels incremental and simple. Can you explain how your approach differs from related work?

Dialogue agent: Our approach builds on the Generative Adversarial Privacy (GAP) method proposed by Huang et al. (2018) by replacing the filter with a generator that replaces sensitive information with synthetic data. This allows our method to maintain privacy while enhancing the utility of the data representation. 

Meta-reviewer: The third review suggests that your proposed method needs to be evaluated on more datasets to establish its consistency and generalizability. Can you discuss your plans to evaluate your method on additional datasets and compare it with other recent works?

Dialogue agent: We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion and know that it is important to ensure that our method is consistent and generalizable across various datasets. We plan to evaluate our method on additional datasets and compare it with recent works in adversarial representation learning to establish its superiority and generalizability.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews and your responses, I think the paper has potential but needs further improvement. I am willing to accept the paper with the condition that you address the reviewers' concerns and provide additional experimental results on more datasets and comparisons with recent works. Are you willing to make such improvements to the paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, we are willing to address the reviewers' concerns and make additional improvements to the paper. Thank you for your feedback and giving us a chance to improve our work.
