Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the paper "Contrastive Adapters for Foundation Model Group Robustness" and I have a few questions for you.

Dialogue agent: Sure, I am happy to help. Please go ahead.

Meta-reviewer: Can you summarize the paper for me?

Dialogue agent: The paper proposes a new method for improving the group robustness of large-scale pre-trained models. Specifically, it uses supervised contrastive learning to train a contrastive adapter on top of the pre-trained model. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the group robustness of the pre-trained models.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the reviews?

Dialogue agent: There are three reviews in total. Review 1 provides a thorough analysis of the proposed method and suggests some additional baselines that could be explored. Review 2 is generally positive about the paper and its contributions, but also suggests some improvements in the clarity of experimental results. Review 3 is mostly positive about the paper, but suggests some weaknesses and areas for improvement.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on the reviews, it seems that the proposed method is technically solid and has high impact. However, there are also some concerns and areas for improvement that need to be addressed. Can you confirm this?

Dialogue agent: Yes, that is correct. Review 1 suggests exploring additional baselines and conducting an ablation study to understand the importance of the proposed sampling procedure and contrastive loss. Review 2 suggests improving the clarity of experimental results, while review 3 suggests comparing the proposed method with another related approach.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 has a confidence level of 4, which means they are confident in their assessment but not absolutely certain. Review 2 has a confidence level of 5, which means they are absolutely certain in their assessment. Review 3 has a confidence level of 4, which is the same as Review 1.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and your responses, it seems that the proposed method is promising, but there are also some concerns and areas for improvement. Given this, I think I will need to carefully consider the confidence levels of the reviewers in making my final decision.
