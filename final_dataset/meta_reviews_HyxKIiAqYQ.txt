Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have received three reviews for the paper entitled "Context-adaptive Entropy Model for End-to-end Optimized Image Compression". As a meta-reviewer, I will assess the reviews and make a final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper. 

Dialogue agent: Hello, I am aware of the reviews and I am available to answer any questions you may have.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Let's start with Review 1. The reviewer is concerned that the paper is not novel enough, given that two prior studies have explored extensions of the prior by introducing an autoregressive component and obtained similar results. What is your response to this concern?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can confirm that the paper presents extensions and modifications to the previous models. The authors have attempted to address the similarity to previous work in their response to the review.

Meta-reviewer: Alright. Let's move on to Review 2. The reviewer suggests that the paper is an incremental update to an existing set of models, which have already been covered in two papers. What is your perspective on this?

Dialogue agent: Again, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, it is worth noting that the paper introduces a variety of modifications and is an improvement over the previous work, as stated by the reviewer. The authors have responded to the similarity to previous work in their rebuttal.

Meta-reviewer: Finally, let's discuss Review 3. The reviewer suggests that the paper is a fine-tuning of the method of Ballé et al. (2018) and may not be sufficiently innovative for publication at ICLR. What is your take on this criticism?

Dialogue agent: The paper does present improvements over Ballé et al. (2018) in terms of the entropy model and modifications to the training algorithm, as stated by the reviewer. The paper also presents promising experimental results. However, as a dialogue agent, I cannot express an opinion or recommendation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I am slightly concerned about the lack of emphasis on the differences from previous work and the discussion on the choice of hyperparameters. How confident are the reviewers in their evaluations of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 expressed confidence level of 4, reflecting a confident but not absolutely certain evaluation. Review 2 expressed a confidence level of 5, indicating a high level of certainty in the evaluation and familiarity with the relevant literature. Review 3 expressed a confidence level of 3, reflecting moderate confidence in the evaluation. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the details. Given the marginal acceptance threshold of review 3, I am hesitant to accept the paper without a more detailed explanation of the differences from previous work and discussions on the hyperparameters. I will provide the authors with a few specific questions to address in their rebuttal before making a final decision. Thank you for your assistance. 

Dialogue agent: You're welcome. Let me know if you have any further questions.
