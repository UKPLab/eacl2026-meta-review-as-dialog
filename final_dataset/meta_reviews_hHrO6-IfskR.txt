 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper called "TabNAS: Rejection Sampling for Neural Architecture Search on Tabular Datasets". Can you tell me about the paper's main contributions and strengths?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a modification to Reinforce, which instead of modifying the reward function to incorporate resource constraints, estimates the feasible set of architectures (e.g. architectures less than some threshold/reference) and updates the probabilities of the controller accordingly by redistributing the probability mass over the feasible set as more trial-and-error progresses. The paper also presents a new rejection sampling method for NAS, which is shown to be effective in finding well-performing architectures. The authors evaluate their method on two datasets, Criteo and Volkert, and achieve lower losses compared to baselines.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper does not compare adequately against all baselines, and the monte carlo sampling is very expensive and this search won't scale for tasks requiring large search spaces. Additionally, the authors did not discuss any potential negative societal impacts of their work.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Okay, I see. What is your rating for this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, I would rate this paper a 5: Borderline accept. The paper is technically solid, with a clear and well-written presentation of the method and related work. However, the paper has some limitations, such as the lack of comparison against all baselines and the expensive sampling method.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: I see. What is your confidence level for this rating?

Dialogue Agent: My confidence level for this rating is 4: I am confident in my assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that I did not understand some parts of the submission or that I am unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on the reviews and your summary, I will consider the paper for acceptance.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help.
