Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am reviewing the reviews for the paper "Self-Tuning Networks: Bilevel Optimization of Hyperparameters using Structured Best-Response Functions." Can you provide me with some more information about the paper and its reviews?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, meta-reviewer. The paper proposes a novel approach to hyperparameter optimization with bilevel optimization and approximation, which can handle discrete parameters. It also dynamically updates the hyperparameters during training for better performance. The paper received two reviews with a rating of 6, and one with a rating of 7.

Meta-reviewer: What are the reviewers' comments on the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 states that the combination of bilevel optimization for hyperparameter tuning with approximation is interesting and the proposed approach readily handles discrete parameters. Reviewer 2 notes that the paper's experimental results are convincing and generalizes a previous idea to handle discrete hyperparameters and scale better.

Meta-reviewer: What about the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 points out that the method depends on some parameters, which can be tricky to make it work in practice. Additionally, there is no theoretical guarantee on the quality of the used approximation for neural networks. Reviewer 3 comments that the writing could be better, the paper doesn't explain well why it works, and the experimental results are just okay.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Are there any questions or concerns raised by the reviewers that stand out as particularly important?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 asks for more explanation on several sections of the paper, including the quality of the approximation and how to set the hyperparameter τ. Reviewer 3 requests for simplified notations and more evidence to show the method's superiority. 

Meta-reviewer: Okay. Lastly, what are the reviewers' confidence levels in their evaluation of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 is confident but not absolutely certain in their evaluation, while reviewers 2 and 3 are fairly confident in their evaluations.
