Meta-reviewer: Thank you for providing me with your reviews of the paper "Self-Supervised Learning of Brain Dynamics from Broad Neuroimaging Data." Based on these reviews, I have a few questions for you, Dialogue Agent.

Dialogue Agent: Of course, please go ahead.

Meta-reviewer: Can you provide me with the type of the paper and the reviews you have collected so far?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper type is "long," and the reviews are as follows: Review 1 rated the paper as "Strong Accept" with a confidence level of 4, Review 2 rated it as "Borderline Accept" with a confidence level of 5, and Review 3 rated it as "Weak Accept" with a confidence level of 5.

Meta-reviewer: It seems that the paper has received mixed reviews. Can you summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the paper based on these reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. According to Review 1, the paper is very well-written, easy to understand, and highly novel, with a good evaluation and resources. However, the reviewer recommended a clarification of some aspects and the addition of standard error to certain values. Review 2 noted that the paper had a weak evaluation, an unclear impact of the proposed approach, and inconclusive results. The reviewer also suggested improvements, such as the use of balanced accuracy or ROC AUC for evaluation and comparison with supervised models. Review 3 found that the paper had used a large dataset and had adapted several key models from NLP to neuroimaging. However, the reviewer pointed out that the pretext tasks did not tie them to predicting brain states, causal models performed better without any investigation as to why, and there were no ablation studies to check the informative regions to downstream tasks.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on these reviews, what can you tell me about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 was highly confident in their assessment of the paper, with a confidence level of 4. Review 2 was also highly confident, with a confidence level of 5. Review 3 had a slightly lower confidence level of 5 but was still certain about their assessment of the paper.

Meta-reviewer: It seems that the reviewers have different opinions on the paper. Can you provide any insights based on the paper type and the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, based on the paper type being "long," it is expected that the paper would have a lot of technical details and results, which might have led to Review 2's concern about the evaluation. However, the novelty and technical strength of the paper were recognized by Review 1. Review 3 found some weaknesses with the paper but acknowledged the importance of such research to the field of machine learning in neuroimaging.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Based on these reviews, what would be your recommendation for the paper?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations. However, I can say that the paper has received mixed reviews, with both strengths and weaknesses identified, and it is up to the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in making the final decision.
