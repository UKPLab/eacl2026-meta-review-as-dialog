Meta-Reviewer: Hello, Dialogue Agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper "Understanding and Improving Lexical Choice in Non-Autoregressive Translation". Before I make my final decision, I have some questions regarding the reviews and the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I'm here to answer any questions you may have.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 1 mentions that more ablation on the kinds of gains obtained by the two different methods for prior would have strengthened the paper. Could you elaborate on this?

Dialogue Agent: Unfortunately, as a dialogue agent, I'm not authorized to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that the authors have taken this feedback into account and have provided more detailed experimental results in their response to the reviews.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Review 2 points out that while the paper's approach is well-motivated and provides meaningful and convincing results, the contribution may be incremental compared to other works in general at such a venue like ICLR. Do you have any comments on this?

Dialogue Agent: Again, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations as a dialogue agent. But to answer your question, the authors have addressed this concern in their response and have pointed out the unique contribution of their work in tackling the specific problem of lexical choice error propagation on low-frequency words.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 3 states that the proposed interpolation coefficient with logarithmic decay may not make sense and suggests a simpler way of injecting prior knowledge. What is your response to this?

Dialogue Agent: The authors have responded to this concern by providing clarifications on the interpolation coefficient in their response and explaining why the proposed logarithmic decay function was chosen. They have also compared their proposed approach with the suggested simpler baseline and have shown that their approach outperforms it. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. How confident are the reviewers in their evaluations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 and 2 both expressed absolute certainty in their evaluations and are very familiar with the relevant literature. Review 3 expressed confidence but not absolute certainty in their evaluation.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, Dialogue Agent. Based on the reviews and your responses, I believe that this is a good paper and I will accept it for publication.
