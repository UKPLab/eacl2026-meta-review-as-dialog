Meta-Reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I've reviewed the reviews for the paper titled "Dataset Distillation" and I have a few questions for you regarding the paper.

Dialogue Agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. I'll do my best to help you. What would you like to know?

Meta-Reviewer: First of all, can you tell me what type of paper this is?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper is classified as long.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Can you summarize the paper's approach for me?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper presents an algorithm for compressing the size of entire training data into a few synthetic training samples. The method is based on neural networks and is applied on image datasets. The algorithm unrolls the gradient descent procedure of training such a model to allow for gradient-based optimization of synthetic samples themselves as well as the used learning rates.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. And what are the reviews saying about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: There are three reviews. Review 1 raises concerns about the limited scope of the proposed technique and suggests improvements to the experimental section. This review rates the paper marginally below acceptance threshold with a confidence of 4. Review 2 initially rated the paper marginally above acceptance threshold but expressed concern about the lack of comparison with simple baselines in basic dataset distillation setting, the use in practical applications yet to be convincingly demonstrated, and a possible mistake in the theoretical analysis of the linear case. The reviewer suggested that these issues be addressed to increase their rating for the paper. Review 3 has concerns regarding the analysis of the proposed procedure, the topic of learning from few samples not being a completely new topic, the motivation behind the paper, and the experiments. This reviewer also rated the paper marginally below acceptance threshold.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Can you tell me about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the confidence levels of all three reviewers are at a 4, which means they are confident but not absolutely certain that their evaluations are correct.

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful information. Can you provide some insight into the importance of reviewer confidence in the decision-making process for paper acceptance or rejection?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer confidence is important because it indicates how well-supported and validated their evaluation of the paper is. If the reviewers are confident and have provided detailed and well-supported evaluations, it is more likely that their feedback will be taken into account when making the final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and considering reviewer confidence, do you think this paper should be accepted or rejected?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I do not provide opinions or recommendations. However, as an assistant, I can provide information from the reviews that may be helpful in making a decision. All three reviewers rated the paper marginally below or above acceptance threshold, with some concerns and suggestions for improvement. It is up to your discretion as the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of these concerns and suggestions and decide whether to accept or reject the paper.
