Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper "The Expressive Power of Deep Neural Networks with Circulant Matrices." Can you please provide me with a summary of the reviews for this paper?

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. The paper has received three reviews. Review 1 is critical of the main contribution claimed in the paper and suggests that the theoretical results provided are not sufficiently justified. Review 2, on the other hand, praises the strong approximation results provided by the authors. However, the review points out issues related to grammatical errors and typos. Review 3 adds that the paper's main contribution, which is to use structured matrices such as circulant and diagonal matrices to speed up computation and reduce memory requirements in NNs, has been previously explored by other papers. The reviewer recommends a head-to-head comparison with tensor-based algorithms such as Novikov et al. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, what is your recommendation regarding the paper's acceptance?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not in a position to provide recommendations or opinions. However, I can inform you that Review 1 gave a rating of 4, suggesting that the paper should be rejected. Review 2 gave a rating of 7 and recommended the paper's acceptance. Finally, Review 3 gave a rating of 6, which is marginally above the acceptance threshold. 

Meta-reviewer: Understood. In that case, can you clarify what the type of the paper is?

Dialogue agent: The paper is classified as long.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Finally, can you provide me with an indication of the confidence level of each reviewer in their evaluation?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 expressed confidence level 4, indicating a high level of confidence but not absolute certainty in their evaluation. Review 2 also expressed confidence level 4. Likewise, Review 3 expressed confidence level 5, indicating absolute certainty in their evaluation and familiarity with the relevant literature. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. It was helpful in making my decision. I will take into account the different opinions of the reviewers and their level of confidence before deciding on the acceptance or rejection of the paper.
