 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Stable Opponent Shaping in Differentiable Games":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Stable Opponent Shaping in Differentiable Games". Can you provide a summary of the paper's main contributions?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The paper focuses on the problem of convergence in multi-objective optimisation with differentiable losses. The authors propose a new algorithm called SOS, which interpolates between LOLA and LookAhead, and demonstrates its local convergence to stable fixed points.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. However, I have some concerns about the proof of Theorem 2. Can you tell me more about that?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The proof of Theorem 2 is related to the expression $u^T M^{-1}GMu$, which has conformable dimensions. The authors assume that $M = (I + \alpha H_d)^{1/2}$, where $H_d$ is the Hessian matrix of the game's objective function. The proof also uses the concept of the symmetric part of $G$, which is not positive definite.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Those are some significant concerns. Can you tell me more about the choice of the interpolation parameter $p$ in SOS?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the choice of $p$ is an important aspect of the SOS algorithm. The authors propose a simple heuristic for choosing $p$, which is based on the distance of the current parameters from the fixed points. The proof of Theorem 4 shows that the choice of $p$ does not affect the local convergence of SOS to stable fixed points.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I appreciate your responses. Based on your summaries, I'm leaning towards accepting the paper, but I have some minor comments. Can you tell me more about the practical implications of the SOS algorithm?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The SOS algorithm has practical implications in terms of performance and convergence. The authors show that SOS can avoid strict saddles and converge to stable fixed points, which can lead to better performance in multi-agent learning scenarios. However, the authors do not provide a thorough evaluation of the algorithm's performance in different scenarios.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your insights. Based on the reviews and your summaries, I have decided to accept the paper with minor revisions. Thank you for your help!

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you. Please let me know if you have any further questions or need any additional help.
