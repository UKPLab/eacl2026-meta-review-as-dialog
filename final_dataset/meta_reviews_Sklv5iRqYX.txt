Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the reviews. Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper proposes a novel approach, MULANN, for multi-domain adversarial learning, and has a clear logic to explain and prove the problem to be solved. However, there are concerns about the experimental results, comparisons with other methods, and the number of classes in each domain. Can you provide a brief overview of the paper's contributions and how it addresses the problem of multi-domain adversarial learning?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. The paper proposes a multi-domain adversarial learning approach, MULANN, to improve the classification accuracy on three datasets in the semi-supervised DA setting. The contributions include using the H-divergence to bound both the risk across all domains and the worst-domain risk, a new loss to accommodate semi-supervised multi-domain learning and domain adaptation, and empirical validation of the approach, improving on the state-of-the-art on two standard image benchmarks, and a novel bioimage dataset, CELL.

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful. Review 1 raised concerns about the experimental results and comparisons with other methods. Can you provide more information about the experiments and how the proposed method compares to other methods?

Dialogue Agent: The paper performs numerous empirical experiments on several types of problems on various datasets, including DIGITS, OFFICE, and CELL, successfully showing how the MULANN can reduce the nasty effects of the adversarial domain discriminator and repulse a fraction of the unlabeled examples from labeled ones in each domain. However, Review 1 suggested that the results were unconvincing, particularly for the CELL dataset. Additionally, the comparison with other methods did not take into account a variety of hyperparameters.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Review 3 also raised concerns about the experiment design, in particular, the lack of experiments in a multiple domain context. Can you provide more information about this?

Dialogue Agent: The paper focuses on adaptation between two domains, while Review 3 expected to see more experiments in a multiple domain context, such as jointly adapting SVHN, MNIST, MNIST-M, and USPS or jointly adapting DSLR, Amazon, and Webcam for OFFICE dataset. Moreover, although the paper introduces the generalization bound for MDL, it does not give a new formulation or algorithm to handle MDL (MULANN only handles the class asymmetry when domains involve distinct sets of classes and has nothing to do with MDL). Hence, there is no connection between the theoretical results on MDL generalization bound and the proposed method MULANN.

Meta-Reviewer: That's concerning. Review 3 also raised concerns about how MULANN can handle false pseudolabeled samples and how the proposed method handles noisy signals conveyed in those false pseudolabeled samples. Can you provide more information about this?

Dialogue Agent: The paper proposes to rank the unlabeled samples of each domain according to the entropy of their classification of the current classifier. Obviously, there must be some false ranking (especially at the initial stages of updating the classifier) for the unlabeled samples, and they may harm the performance of adaptation. However, the paper does not provide information on how MULANN can handle false pseudolabeled samples and how its performance varies with the noisy signals conveyed in those false pseudolabeled samples.

Meta-Reviewer: I understand. Overall, it seems that the paper proposes a novel approach to multi-domain adversarial learning, but there are concerns about the experimental results, comparison with other methods, and the lack of experiments in a multiple domain context. Based on the confidence ratings provided by the reviewers, Review 1 is less confident in their evaluation, while Reviews 2 and 3 are more confident in their evaluations. As the meta-reviewer, I need to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in making the final decision. 

Dialogue Agent: That is correct. As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide any opinions or recommendations. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews, I have decided to reject the paper. While the paper proposes a novel approach to multi-domain adversarial learning, the concerns raised by the reviewers about the experimental results, comparison with other methods, and the lack of experiments in a multiple domain context are significant. Additionally, the difference in confidence levels among the reviewers makes it difficult to make a confident decision to accept the paper.
