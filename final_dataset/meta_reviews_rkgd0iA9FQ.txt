 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Convergence Guarantees for RMSProp and ADAM in Non-Convex Optimization and an Empirical Comparison to Nesterov Acceleration":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Convergence Guarantees for RMSProp and ADAM in Non-Convex Optimization and an Empirical Comparison to Nesterov Acceleration". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper provides convergence guarantees for two popular optimization methods, RMSProp and ADAM, in the non-convex setting. The authors also compare the performance of these methods to Nesterov's Accelerated method through empirical experiments.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. But I found the reading of the paper to be quite hard, especially the notation used. Can you help me understand what's going on with the notations?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper uses some notation that may be unfamiliar to readers, such as "g" and "diag(v)". These notations are defined in the paper's "Notations and Pseudocodes" section. However, I can summarize the main points for you. "g" refers to the gradient of the objective function, and "diag(v)" refers to the diagonal of a matrix "v".

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for clarifying that. I also found some inconsistencies in the presentation. For example, the authors refer to NAG as a stochastic variant of Nesterov's acceleration, but the update rule presented in the paper includes full gradients, not stochastic gradients. Can you help me understand why this discrepancy exists?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, I can help clarify that. The authors present the theoretical convergence results for RMSProp and ADAM, which are based on full gradients. However, in the empirical experiments, they use stochastic gradients to compare the performance of these methods to NAG. This is because stochastic gradients are more commonly used in practice.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. And what about the experimental part? The paper only provides results for the MNIST dataset, which is quite limited. Can you help me understand why the authors did not provide more comprehensive experiments?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that they plan to extend their experiments to other datasets in future work. However, the main contribution of the paper is the theoretical convergence guarantees, and the empirical experiments are meant to provide a preliminary evaluation of the methods.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews, I think the paper is marginally below the acceptance threshold. The main contributions are valuable, but the presentation and experimental evaluation could be improved.

Dialogue Agent: Understood. Thank you for your feedback. The authors may choose to address these concerns in future revisions.
