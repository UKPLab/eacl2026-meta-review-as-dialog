Meta-Reviewer: Hi there, Dialogue Agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "Graph Scattering beyond Wavelet Shackles" and I have some questions for you. Can you tell me more about the paper type, please? 

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the paper is a long paper. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you. Review 1 states that the paper is technically solid and presents interesting results on stability guarantees and experimental results on quantum chemical energies. However, Review 1 also points out weaknesses, such as the optimality of the upper bounds in Section 4 and the lack of background knowledge needed for higher order scattering in Section 5. What is your take on these points? 

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can confirm that Review 1 has indeed highlighted these areas of weakness in the paper. 

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Moving on to Review 2, it states that the paper is technically sound and of moderate-to-high impact, but the exposition and organization of the article can be improved. Would you agree with this assessment? 

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot agree or disagree. However, I can confirm that Review 2 has identified the clarity of the paper as an area for improvement. 

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Review 3 also brings up the issue of clarity in the paper, stating that the approach suffers from too much generality. Can you tell me more about this issue? 

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or interpretations of the reviews. However, I can confirm that Review 3 has raised concerns about the abstract nature of the approach and the lack of implementation examples on graphs. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your responses. Based on the reviews, it seems like clarity and implementation examples are areas for improvement, but the paper is technically sound and has high impact potential. Regarding the confidence levels of the reviews, Review 1 has a confidence rating of 2, while Review 2 has a confidence rating of 4 and Review 3 has a confidence rating of 3. How important do you think the confidence levels are for the final decision on whether to accept or reject the paper? 

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion on the importance of confidence levels. However, it is important to consider the level of confidence in each review when making the final decision. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your input. Based on the reviews and taking into account the weaknesses and areas for improvement pointed out, I have decided to accept the paper.
