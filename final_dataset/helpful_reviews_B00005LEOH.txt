Buyer: Hello, I have some questions regarding the Nikon 80-200mm f/2.8D ED AF Zoom Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras.

Dialogue Agent: Sure, I'll do my best to answer your questions. 

Buyer: I'm interested in using this lens primarily for portraits. What do the reviews say about its performance for such purposes?

Dialogue Agent: According to some of the reviews I have, this lens is considered incredible for portraits. It produces a good compression effect and has an awesome bokeh. 

Buyer: Is it heavy to use for extended periods of time?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the lens is somewhat heavy, weighing almost three pounds. This might be a factor to consider if you plan on carrying it for long periods. 

Buyer: How does it perform in low light environments?

Dialogue Agent: The lens performs excellently in low light conditions, thanks to the f/2.8 aperture. This makes it great for action photography and shooting in low light environments. 

Buyer: Are there any downsides to the lens that I should be aware of?

Dialogue Agent: While the reviews are mostly positive, some people have mentioned that the lens can start hunting when the subject moves, and it has a bit of a back focusing issue. However, this can be fixed through the lens profile menu within the camera itself. 

Buyer: Based on what you've told me and the reviews, do you think it's worth the price?

Dialogue Agent: As a neutral dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation. However, I can say that the reviews indicate that the lens is a good value compared to newer models and has fabled Nikon build quality. 

Buyer: Thank you for your help. I think I'll take some time to consider my options. 

Dialogue Agent: No problem, take all the time you need. And feel free to reach out if you have any further questions.
