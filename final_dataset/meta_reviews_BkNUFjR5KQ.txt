 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Learning Internal Dense But External Sparse Structures of Deep Neural Network":

Turn 1:
Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Learning Internal Dense But External Sparse Structures of Deep Neural Network". Can you tell me what the paper is about?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new network structure that combines the density of CNNs and the sparsity of external connections. The authors claim that this approach can improve the performance of deep neural networks.

Turn 2:
Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The authors propose a new network structure that enables locally dense yet externally sparse connections. They also present an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the network architecture. Additionally, the paper includes an ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Turn 3:
Meta-reviewer: I see. What are the reviewers' opinions on the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews provided, Reviewer 1 believes that the paper presents an interesting and important direction in searching better network architectures. However, they suggest that the overall paper needs to be polished more, with errors and typos that need to be corrected. Reviewer 2 notes that the paper proposes a novel approach, but there is a lack of discussion on the novelty of the work and how it differs from similar existing works. Reviewer 3 praises the paper for combining two important components of deep neural networks and presents an interesting work.

Turn 4:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper according to the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: According to Reviewer 1, the paper has a strong contribution in proposing a new network structure and an effective evolutionary algorithm to optimize it. However, Reviewer 1 suggests that the paper needs to be polished more in terms of typos and errors. Reviewer 2 notes that the paper lacks discussion on the novelty of the work and how it differs from similar existing works. Reviewer 3 praises the paper for combining two important components of deep neural networks and presents an interesting work.

Turn 5:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and your summaries, how do you assess the paper's acceptance or rejection?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper has a marginal acceptance threshold, with reviewers praising the paper's contribution and novelty, but also noting areas for improvement such as polishing the paper and providing more discussion on the novelty of the work. The confidence of the reviewers is moderate, with Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 3 being more confident in their evaluations.

Turn 6:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your assessment. I will consider the reviews and your summaries when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I hope this information helps you make a well-informed decision.
