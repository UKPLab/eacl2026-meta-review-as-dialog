Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the reviews for the paper on Domain Generalization by Learning and Removing Domain-specific Features. Based on the reviews, I am still on the fence on whether to accept or reject this paper. Can you provide me more information on the experimental results?

Dialogue agent: Certainly, meta-reviewer. The paper proposes a novel framework for domain generalization that learns and removes domain-specific features. The experiments show that the proposed method consistently improves the baseline on PACS, VLCS, and Office-Home with different backbone architectures. Furthermore, the use of Proxy A-distance and the generalization bound is very welcome in the paper for showing that the model truly generalizes.

Meta-reviewer: That's good to hear. What about the weaknesses mentioned in Review 1 and Review 2 regarding the method's limitations and the lack of theoretical guarantees?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can confirm that the paper acknowledges the limitation that the method needs to pass the input image through the encoder-decoder network and it makes an overhead in inference time. Regarding the lack of theoretical guarantees mentioned in Review 2, the paper presents a theoretical result about the generalization bound in Theorem 2. However, it is important to note that the authors themselves state that the model is not able to remove domain-specific features that regard unseen domains, and Review 3 also mentions the limitation that some domain-specific knowledge is useful for some domains.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Can you also clarify Review 1's concern on whether maximizing the classifier uncertainty of a domain-specific classifier guarantees the removal of domain-specific features?

Dialogue agent: Based on my understanding of the paper, the proposed method explicitly designs a training scheme to remove domain-specific features. The encoder-decoder network is trained together with another domain-invariant classifier so that the domain-specific classifiers cannot discriminate the classes of transformed images but the domain-invariant classifier can classify them. The uncertainty loss is used to prevent the domain-specific classifiers from overfitting. However, as Review 1 pointed out, there could be potential ways for the encoder-decoder network to cheat and include domain-specific features. So, while the proposed training scheme seems effective in the experiments, it may not guarantee the complete removal of domain-specific features in all cases.
