Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I'm reviewing the paper "PAC Confidence Predictions for Deep Neural Network Classifiers." Can you tell me a bit about the reviews that were submitted for this paper?

Dialogue agent: Sure. There were three reviews submitted for this paper. Reviewer 1 rated the paper a 6 out of 10, but after the author's rebuttal, they updated their score to a 6 out of 10. They were confident but not absolutely certain about their evaluation. Reviewer 2 rated the paper a 7 out of 10 and was willing to defend their evaluation, but they were not as confident as Reviewer 1. Finally, Reviewer 3 rated the paper a 6 out of 10 and was also confident but not absolutely certain about their evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: Thanks for the overview. Can you give me a summary of the main critiques and concerns that the reviewers had?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 felt that the paper was promising, but that some important information was missing. They pointed out that the assumptions made about the test data being in-distribution could be limiting and that calibration performance was not included in the experimental results. They also asked for accuracy-vs-coverage curves and comparisons to other methods.

Reviewer 2 had several concerns as well, including issues with the definitions, clarifications on how the intervals can improve classifier uncertainty, and concerns about the PAC definition. They also had questions about the safe planning application and the necessity of the iid assumption.

Finally, Reviewer 3 recommended acceptance of the paper, but they still had critiques and points of confusion about the key ideas, as well as concerns about notation errors and language precision.

Meta-reviewer: Hmm, sounds like there are valid concerns and critiques from all three reviews. As the meta-reviewer, I need to weigh the importance of these critiques. Do all three reviewers seem equally confident about their assessments?

Dialogue agent: No, Reviewer 2 was the least confident, while the other two were confident but not absolutely certain.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, that's good to know. I'll take that into account. Given the concerns of the reviewers, I'll need to read the paper more carefully and probably solicit additional reviews before making a final decision. Thanks for your help, dialogue agent.
