 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Graph Neural Networks with Adaptive Readouts":

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper titled "Graph Neural Networks with Adaptive Readouts". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper introduces adaptive readouts for graph neural networks, which allow for improved performance on some datasets and tasks. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of different readout functions and compare them to traditional non-adaptive readouts.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper has several strengths, including a comprehensive empirical evaluation on 40 datasets and a wide range of domains. The authors also provide an ablation study to highlight the impact of various parts of the model. However, some aspects of the empirical evaluation are not fully clear, and there are some missing references in the paper.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: Can you tell me more about the missing references?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, there are some recent works in the field that are not discussed in the paper. For example, the Sortpool and DiffPool methods, which are widely used graph-level aggregators, are not mentioned. Additionally, there is a recent survey on the connections of graph neural networks to machine learning that could be relevant to the paper.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for bringing those to my attention. Based on your assessment, would you recommend accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the technical solidity and impact of the paper, I would recommend a weak accept. The paper has several strengths, but there are some issues with the empirical evaluation and missing references that need to be addressed.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your input. I will take your recommendations into consideration when making my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with.
