Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed the paper "Non-Markovian Reward Modelling from Trajectory Labels via Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning". Based on the reviews, I am unsure whether to accept or reject the paper. Can you provide me with more information about the paper and its reviews?

Dialogue agent: Of course, I can provide you with more information about the paper and its reviews. The paper proposes a new method for reward modeling with non-Markovian rewards, using multiple instance learning with LSTMs to encode hidden state information. The authors test the proposed method in four environments designed to demonstrate non-Markovian properties. Reviewer 1 gives a positive review of the paper, stating that the theory behind the method is sound, the experiments are good, and the writing is clear. Reviewer 1 has some criticism of the experiments and presents two questions related to the wider applicability of the method. Reviewer 2 gives constructive criticism of the paper, stating that while the improvements to MIL with LSTM are effective, more complex environments should be included in the evaluation. Reviewer 3 gives a positive review and suggests that comparisons with other models in more complex RL tasks should be included. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. I appreciate the positive aspects of the proposed method, but I am concerned about the issues raised by the reviewers. Reviewer 1 has two questions related to the wider applicability of the method, and Reviewer 2 suggests that more complex environments should be included in the evaluation. Can you provide me with more information about these issues?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 raises two questions related to the wider applicability of the method. The first question is related to the method being presented as reward-modeling for POMDPs instead of non-Markovian reward decision processes. The reviewer suggests that the solution becomes obvious if the method is presented as reward modeling for POMDPs. The second question is related to the experiments and whether they make a stronger case that the method is applicable and helpful for larger-scale, real-world tasks. Reviewer 2 suggests that the proposed method would face difficulties when dealing with a more challenging environment and that results on more complex environments should be included in the evaluation.

Meta-reviewer: I see. These are valid concerns that need to be addressed. Is there anything else that I should consider before making a decision on the paper?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 suggests that comparisons with other models in more complex RL tasks should be included in the evaluation. Also, Reviewer 3 suggests that the paper should include results on more challenging environments. Overall, the paper has good writing and clear presentation, and the proposed method has potential to be useful in real-world applications involving human interactions. However, the lack of evaluation on more complex environments and comparisons with other models can be a limitation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the additional information. Based on the reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper with minor revisions. I would like to see the proposed method evaluated on more complex environments and compared with other models, as suggested by Reviewers 2 and 3. These revisions will address the concerns raised by the reviewers and improve the quality of the paper.
