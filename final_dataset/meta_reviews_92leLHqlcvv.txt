Meta-reviewer: Thank you for being here. I have read the reviews for the paper "A Direct Approximation of AIXI Using Logical State Abstractions" and I have some questions. Is the paper technically sound?

Dialogue agent: Both reviews 1 and 2 gave a rating of 6, which corresponds to a weak accept and technically solid paper. However, review 2 mentioned some weaknesses in the experimental results, such as the lack of baseline comparisons and the limitations in the treatment of reward as a categorical variable.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Has the paper been evaluated for its impact?

Dialogue agent: Both reviews 1 and 2 gave a rating of moderate-to-high impact.

Meta-reviewer: And what about the reproducibility of the experiments and the ethical considerations?

Dialogue agent: I apologize, but the reviews do not provide information on these aspects.

Meta-reviewer: Alright, thank you for letting me know. Review 1 mentioned that the reviewer did not have sufficient expertise to judge the correctness of the theoretical contributions. Should I take this into account when making a decision?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 also mentioned that the considered problem of incorporating logical state abstraction in the AIXI framework is interesting and well motivated, and that the problem formulation and the theoretical contributions are well explained. While it is important to consider the reviewers' confidence in their assessments, it is ultimately up to you to decide how to weigh their feedback.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Review 2 mentioned the weaknesses in the experimental results. Can you tell me more about this?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 noted that while the epidemic domain considered in the experiments appears challenging and interesting, there were no baseline comparisons with alternative approaches, and the treatment of reward as a categorical variable was limiting. The reviewer also suggested that alternative feature selection strategies, alternative model learning algorithms, or alternative planning algorithms may perform better than the proposed methods.

Meta-reviewer: I see. It seems that more work is needed to evaluate the proposed approach. Thank you for your answers. Based on the reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper, but I will take into account the weaknesses mentioned by the reviewers.
