Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for providing your reviews. It appears that we have one very strong accept, one weak accept, and one weak accept with a rating of 6. Can you please provide your perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses outlined in the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Of course. Review 1 highlights the importance of evaluating our proposed metric on more challenging datasets and using different backbones for our method. They also suggest presenting more demonstration figures to help explain weaknesses of other methods and how our proposed method addresses them. However, they overall have a positive view on our proposed method and think it can be helpful for future Open-Set Recognition research.

Review 2 provides a very positive review with no major weaknesses identified, while Review 3 suggests that we should have compared OpenAUC to OSCR and evaluated our approach with other metrics, such as closed-set accuracy and AUROC. They also raise concerns about the potential limitations and negative societal impacts of relying on a summary number metric.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for summarizing. It seems that there is some disagreement on the importance of evaluating our approach using multiple metrics. Can you speak more to the importance of evaluating with other metrics and addressing the potential limitations and negative societal impacts raised in Review 3?

Dialogue Agent: While OpenAUC is a novel metric that addresses the limitations of existing metrics, it is still important to evaluate our approach using other well-established metrics to ensure that it is not sacrificing performance in other areas. Additionally, it is important to consider the broader impact of relying on a summary number metric in real-world applications and how it may affect different operating points and use cases. We will address these concerns in our revision by including an evaluation of our approach using other metrics and discussing potential limitations and negative societal impacts in the paper.
