Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today. I have a few questions regarding the reviews of the paper PCPs: Patient Cardiac Prototypes. 

Dialogue agent: Sure, I'll do my best to answer your questions. 

Meta-reviewer: Review 1 raised concerns about the novelty of the paper compared to other concurrent papers. Can you tell me more about the related works and if the authors acknowledged them? 

Dialogue agent: Yes, the authors did acknowledge similar works submitted to the same venue, namely DROPS, CLOPS, and CLOCS. However, Review 3 mentioned that the authors are ignorant to several lines of existing literature in deep learning for healthcare, particularly deep phenotyping and deep patient subtyping. They also do not seem to be aware of existing works on explaining Black-box models. Several works were mentioned as references that the authors could have used for comparison and evaluation, including some related works on contrastive learning on ECG signals. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that information. Review 1 also mentioned confusion about the hypernetwork module. Can you explain this in more detail? 

Dialogue agent: Unfortunately, as a dialogue agent, I am not permitted to provide opinions or explanations beyond what is present in the reviews. However, I can confirm that Review 3 also mentioned that the detailed implementation of hypernetwork could be discussed, as well as the computational complexity of the proposed method.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Moving on to Review 2, they suggested having a comparison with existing phenotypic (clustering) approaches that have been proposed and showed how this new model is better. What is your take on this? 

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide a take or opinion. However, I can confirm that Review 3 agreed that the paper lacks baselines and does not include any comparison with existing works. They also mentioned that the experiment results are mostly unconvincing and suggested using quantitative clustering metrics to demonstrate results and to analyze the computational complexity of the proposed method.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Finally, Review 3 seemed to be the most critical of the paper and even gave it a strong rejection. Can you tell me more about their concerns? 

Dialogue agent: Review 3 had several concerns, including the lack of novelty, lack of baselines, and unconvincing experiment results. They also mentioned issues with the hypernetwork module, the motivation of the paper, and missing related works on contrastive learning. Review 3 suggested that the methodology of the paper consists of a standard contrastive learning method and a standard meta-learning setting that have been done in one or more existing works, and the paper does not offer any significant contributions. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the thorough explanation. Based on these reviews, it seems that the paper has some significant limitations. However, Review 1 did suggest the paper was very well written and the experiments were comprehensive. Can you tell me more about the experiments? 

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I cannot provide detailed information beyond what is contained in the reviews. However, Review 1 did mention that the paper provides comprehensive experiments, including both qualitative analysis and quantitative results, to show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. They specifically enjoyed the Euclidean distance plots. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, that's helpful. Based on these reviews, I must weigh the reviewer confidence in making my decision. Review 3 was very confident in their evaluation and was familiar with the relevant literature. However, the other reviews were less confident. Overall, it seems that there are some significant concerns about the novelty and evaluation of the paper, and that the paper would benefit from comparisons with existing works. I will take these factors into consideration when making my decision. 

Dialogue agent: Understood. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist with. 

Meta-reviewer: That's all for now. Thank you for your help.
