 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi there! I'm reviewing a paper called "Defending against black-box adversarial attacks with gradient-free trained sign activation neural networks". Can you help me understand the main idea of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a new method for defending against black-box adversarial attacks using gradient-free trained sign activation neural networks. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method using the HopSkipJump attack.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. But I have some concerns regarding the paper. Firstly, the paper organization is very weird and confusing. The authors did not put their main algorithm into the main paper but instead put many unimportant results into the supplementary material. What do you think about this?

Dialogue Agent: I understand the reviewer's concern. The authors may have prioritized providing a comprehensive overview of their method and its performance, which led to including some results in the supplementary material. However, the main algorithm is essential to understanding the paper's contributions, and it should be presented clearly in the main paper.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Another concern I have is that the authors only evaluate their method using the HopSkipJump attack. Don't you think it's essential to test the method's robustness against other black-box attack methods as well?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, the reviewer raises a valid point. Evaluating the method's robustness against multiple attack methods would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness. The authors could consider adding more attack methods to their evaluation.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I also noticed that the paper provides detailed results for 10 random images in Table 2, 3. Do you think these results are necessary, and why?

Dialogue Agent: The results in Tables 2 and 3 provide valuable insights into the method's performance under different conditions. However, the reviewer raises a valid point that these results may not be essential to understanding the paper's contributions. The authors could consider reducing the number of results or focusing on the most critical ones.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Finally, I have some concerns regarding the paper's citing issue. The authors cite some papers using their arXiv versions instead of the published versions. What do you think about this?

Dialogue Agent: The reviewer raises a valid point. It is essential to cite published versions of papers instead of arXiv versions to ensure accuracy and consistency. The authors should ensure that they cite the correct versions of the papers they reference.

Output:

Based on the dialogue, the meta-reviewer is concerned about the paper's organization, the choice of attack method used for evaluation, the detailed results provided, and the citing issue. The dialogue agent responds by addressing each concern and providing suggestions for improvement. The final decision regarding the paper's acceptance will depend on the reviewer's confidence in the paper's contributions and the authors' ability to address these concerns.
