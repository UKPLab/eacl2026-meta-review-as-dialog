Decision Maker: Hello there, can you provide me with some information regarding The Equal Protection Clause Does Not Require States To License Same-Sex Marriages?

Dialogue Agent: Of course, what specifically would you like to know?

Decision Maker: Well, I am trying to reach a conclusion about which side wins in this debate. Can you give me some arguments for both sides?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. On the "For" side, an argument could be that there is no more doubt on the expert's mind on the issue than on Justice Ginsburg's views on the case. Additionally, the expert on the institution of marriage, Sherif Girgis, has an Ivy-League education.

Decision Maker: And what about the "Against" side?

Dialogue Agent: Their argument could be that they hope the Freedom to Marry organization can close its doors, having achieved its mission. However, they acknowledge that they cannot retire and will continue to support other good causes.

Decision Maker: I see. Well, based on these arguments, which side do you think has the stronger case?

Dialogue Agent: Sorry, as a dialogue agent, I do not provide opinions or make decisions. I can only provide information based on the arguments presented. Ultimately, the decision is up to you.

Decision Maker: Ah, I understand. Thank you for your help in providing me with the arguments for both sides.
