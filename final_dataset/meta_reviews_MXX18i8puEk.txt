 Sure! Here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Nest Your Adaptive Algorithm for Parameter-Agnostic Nonconvex Minimax Optimization":

Turn 1:
Meta-reviewer: Hello! I've been assigned to review a paper titled "Nest Your Adaptive Algorithm for Parameter-Agnostic Nonconvex Minimax Optimization". Can you help me understand the main contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes an adaptive framework, called NeAda, for solving nonconvex-strongly concave (NC-SC) minimax problems. The NeAda framework achieves the best-known rates both in the deterministic and stochastic settings up to logarithmic factors, while being agnostic to the problem parameters.

Turn 2:
Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the theoretical contributions of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper provides a set of independent but complementary results such as non-convergence of gradient descent ascent, the high probability convergence of NeAda-AdaGrad, and regret bounds for a generalized parameter-agnostic AdaGrad template. The authors also provide a set of experiments demonstrating the advantages of their framework.

Turn 3:
Meta-reviewer: I see. Can you help me understand the limitations of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper focuses on the nested adaptive algorithm and its theoretical behavior, but the authors do not provide a thorough discussion on the parameter-free online learning and adaptive regret bounds for strongly convex losses. Additionally, the statement of Theorem 3.2 is not precise enough, and the quantity $\mathcal E$ is crucial part of the total sample complexity.

Turn 4:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews, I have some concerns about the paper's technical solidity and the need for more thorough discussions on certain aspects of the paper. Can you provide any additional information to address these concerns?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors discuss the limitations and shortcomings of their results with respect to the literature. Additionally, they provide a detailed analysis of the sample complexity of the NeAda framework, which addresses the concerns raised by the reviewers.

Turn 5:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and the additional information provided, I will give my final decision. The paper is technically solid, but there are some limitations and shortcomings that need to be addressed. I will rate the paper as a 5: Borderline accept, with a confidence level of 2.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your review. The feedback will be helpful for the authors in improving their paper. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.
