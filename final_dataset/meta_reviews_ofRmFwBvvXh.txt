Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you please provide an overview of the paper and its main contributions? 

Dialogue agent: Certainly. This paper proposes new error bounds for approximating functions in Sobolev space using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with a focus on binary classification tasks. The authors show that there is greater flexibility in decreasing these bounds by controlling network depth and filter size, and the new error bounds have been shown to depend on the functions’ ambient space dimension polynomially. The authors also address the curse of dimensionality by showing that if the target function is approximately supported over a lower dimensional manifold, then the tightness of the error bound is further increased. 

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what type of paper is it? 

Dialogue agent: It is a long paper. 

Meta-reviewer: Okay, thank you. Can you tell me a bit more about the reviews? 

Dialogue agent: There are three reviews. Reviewer 1 rates the paper as borderline reject due to limited evaluation, while still acknowledging its technical soundness and potential significance. Reviewer 2 rates the paper as accept, noting its technical solidity, high impact, and good evaluation. Reviewer 3 rates the paper as very strong accept, citing its flawlessness, groundbreaking impact, and excellent evaluation. 

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. Can you provide me with more details about the strengths and weaknesses mentioned in the reviews? 

Dialogue agent: Reviewers 1 and 2 praise the technical soundness and clear presentation of the paper, as well as the authors' attention to detail and their contributions in addressing the curse of dimensionality in classification tasks. Reviewer 1, however, notes that the authors have overlooked some recent work on the same topic and that the limitations of the paper to binary classification tasks should be addressed. Reviewer 2, on the other hand, suggests that a toy example could have been included to compare the theoretical function approximation bounds to numerical ones. Reviewer 3 commends the authors for their innovative approach and their contributions to the field. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the detailed responses. Can you give me your opinion on the paper and whether it should be accepted or rejected? 

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not able to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can tell you that the reviews are mixed and vary in their level of confidence in their assessments. It is up to you, as the meta-reviewer, to weigh the strengths and weaknesses of the paper and make a decision based on your own judgment.
