 Sure, I can simulate a dialogue between a dialogue agent and a meta-reviewer assessing a paper for acceptance or rejection. The meta-reviewer is aware only of the paper's title, "Undersampling is a Minimax Optimal Robustness Intervention in Nonparametric Classification." The dialogue agent has access to the reviews and the paper type (long).

Dialogue Agent: Hello, I'm here to assist you in assessing the paper "Undersampling is a Minimax Optimal Robustness Intervention in Nonparametric Classification." Could you please provide me with your initial thoughts on the paper?

Meta-Reviewer: Well, I have some concerns about the main theoretical results of the paper, specifically Theorems 4.1 and 4.2. I believe they are either vacuous or trivial, and I would like to hear your thoughts on this matter.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for sharing your concerns. Based on the reviews, Reviewer 1 states that "The paper points out that minimax excess risk is lower bounded by a function of only the size of the minority group without additional parametric model assumptions or knowledge of the problem at hand." Reviewer 2 also mentions that "The authors provide some experiments that confirm the results." However, Reviewer 3 has some serious concerns about the main theoretical results. Could you elaborate on your concerns and why you believe they are either vacuous or trivial?

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, I believe that the constant $c$ in Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 is problematic. In the proof of Thm 4.1, there is a typo on line 514, and the additional details provided in the rebuttal do not address my concerns about the proof of Thm 4.2. Furthermore, I question the significance of the lower bounds presented in the paper, as they are either vacuous or trivial depending on how $n_{maj}$ is related to $n_{min}$.

Dialogue Agent: I see. Based on the reviews, the paper seems to have some novel ideas and a nice story, but there are some concerns about the main theoretical results. Could you provide more information on what you believe needs to be fixed in order for the paper to be accepted?

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, I believe that the paper needs to address the issues with Theorems 4.1 and 4.2. Perhaps the authors could provide alternative baselines or modifications to the theorems that address the concerns I have raised. Additionally, I would like to see more information on how the lower bounds are derived and their significance in the context of class imbalance.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your input. Based on the reviews and your feedback, I would recommend that the paper be accepted with revisions. The authors should address the concerns raised by Reviewer 3 and provide more information on the significance of the lower bounds presented in the paper. The paper has some novel ideas and a nice story, and with the requested revisions, it has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the field.

Meta-Reviewer: I agree. Thank you for your assistance in evaluating this paper. I will take your recommendations into consideration when making my final decision.
