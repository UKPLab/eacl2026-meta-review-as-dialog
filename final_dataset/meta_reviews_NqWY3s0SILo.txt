 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Differentiable Graph Optimization for Neural Architecture Search":

Turn 1:
Meta-reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Differentiable Graph Optimization for Neural Architecture Search". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a method called Graph Optimized Neural Architecture Learning (GOAL) that uses a differentiable surrogate model to directly optimize the graph structures for neural architecture search.

Turn 2:
Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main concerns of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews provided, the reviewers have concerns about the method's reliance on continuous relaxation, the lack of ablation studies to verify the advantages of the proposed method, and the limited evaluation on larger models and search spaces.

Turn 3:
Meta-reviewer: Can you summarize the reviews for me?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. Review 1 expresses concerns about the method's reliance on continuous relaxation and the lack of ablation studies. Review 2 suggests that the method is similar to NAO and has limitations in applying to larger models and search spaces. Review 3 raises concerns about the method's necessity and suggests comparing to better baselines and providing more details on the number of samples used to train the surrogate function.

Turn 4:
Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. Based on the reviews, I'm leaning towards rejecting the paper. Can you provide any insights that might change my decision?

Dialogue Agent: While the reviews do raise some concerns, the paper does demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on NAS-bench. Additionally, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the method's effectiveness and provide a thorough evaluation of the proposed approach. However, the limited evaluation on larger models and search spaces may be a concern for some reviewers. Ultimately, the decision to accept or reject the paper should be based on the reviewer's confidence in the evaluation and the significance of the proposed method in the field of neural architecture search.
