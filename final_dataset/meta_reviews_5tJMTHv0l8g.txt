 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Stego Networks: Information Hiding on Deep Neural Networks":

Turn 1:
Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Stego Networks: Information Hiding on Deep Neural Networks". Can you provide a summary of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a method for hiding information in the weights of deep neural networks, specifically in the fractional parts of the parameters. The authors evaluate the capacity and sensitivity of different neural network layers to perturbations and demonstrate the feasibility of hiding information in the weights without being easily detectable.

Turn 2:
Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The main strengths of the paper are its novel approach to information hiding and the demonstration of the feasibility of hiding information in the weights of deep neural networks. However, the paper has some weaknesses, such as the lack of a thorough exploration of the relationship between the quantity of information that can be hidden and the size/number of parameters, and the absence of a more detailed evaluation of the robustness of the proposed method.

Turn 3:
Meta-Reviewer: Can you provide more details on the sensitivity analysis and fine-tuning procedures mentioned in the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The authors perform sensitivity analysis to select the least sensitive parameters to use for information hiding, and they fine-tune the model after embedding the information to recover the model performance. However, the paper does not provide a detailed evaluation of the effectiveness of these procedures.

Turn 4:
Meta-Reviewer: I see. What are the authors' main contributions to the field, and how do they relate to previous work?

Dialogue Agent: The authors contribute a novel approach to information hiding in deep neural networks, which expands the range of possible steganography techniques. However, there has been previous work on information hiding in neural networks, such as Song et al. (2017), which also investigates how information can be imperceptibly embedded and recovered from neural networks. The authors do not provide a detailed comparison of their approach with previous work.

Turn 5:
Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, what is your recommendation for acceptance or rejection?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the novelty of the approach, the feasibility demonstration, and the potential applications of the proposed method, I would recommend accepting the paper with minor revisions to address the lack of a more detailed evaluation of the robustness of the proposed method and the absence of a comparison with previous work. However, the final decision should consider the meta-reviewer's confidence in the evaluation.
