 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "The Recurrent Neural Tangent Kernel". The meta-reviewer is aware only of the paper's title and relies on the dialogue agent, equipped with reviews and paper type information, to make a final decision.

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I am reviewing a paper titled "The Recurrent Neural Tangent Kernel". Can you tell me more about this paper?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! The Recurrent Neural Tangent Kernel (RNTK) is a paper that derives the neural tangent kernel for RNNs in the infinite-width limit. It shows several interesting features of such networks and provides estimates that look correct. The paper has high-quality writing and notations, and the reviewer confidence is fairly high.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. Can you tell me more about the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7 and confidence of 4. One reviewer mentions that the techniques are not particularly new, but the paper is still an interesting and useful contribution. Another reviewer notes that the paper is well-written and provides nontrivial estimates. However, one reviewer has some concerns about the empirical side and the choice of datasets.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the concerns regarding the empirical side?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, one reviewer notes that the paper claims to restrict the data with shorter and fewer samples, which may be a downside of the proposed method as the goal of RNNs is to handle various length of data samples. Additionally, the reviewer wonders why the proposed RNTK cannot outperform other SOA methods.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: That's helpful information. What about the choice of datasets?

Dialogue Agent: The paper chooses 53 UCR classification datasets out of the 128 available, and the reviewer questions why those 53 datasets were chosen out of the 128 available. The reviewer also notes that the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the datasets were chosen.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and your summary, I think I have a good understanding of the paper. Can you tell me more about the confidence of the reviewers?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The reviewer confidence is fairly high, with an average rating of 4 and a confidence of 3. However, one reviewer has a lower confidence of 2, possibly due to the concerns about the empirical side.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on the reviews and the confidence of the reviewers, I think I have a good understanding of the paper. I will now make my final decision.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for the opportunity to assist you. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
