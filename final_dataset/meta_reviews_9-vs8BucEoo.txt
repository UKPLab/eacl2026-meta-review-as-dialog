Meta-reviewer: Hello, can you provide me with an overview of the paper "Best of Both Worlds Model Selection"?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper deals with the problem of model selection in linear bandits, proposing a novel algorithm called Arbe and a two-stage algorithm called Arbe-Gap. These algorithms achieve the first high probability regret bound for adversarial model selection and best-of-both-worlds high probability regret bounds, respectively.

Meta-reviewer: I see. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 notes that the writing is mostly clear, the best-of-both-worlds guarantees for model selection is an interesting and important problem, and the proposed algorithms are novel. However, they mention that both stochastic and adversarial regret bounds are suboptimal with respect to the dimension of the reward vectors and that the paper does not contain numerical experiments for the proposed algorithms. Review 2 identifies no specific weaknesses and notes that the paper is clearly written and easy to understand.

Meta-reviewer: Review 2 also recommends accepting the paper. What is your assessment of the paper quality and significance?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 rates the paper as technically solid, with high impact on at least one sub-area, or moderate-to-high impact on more than one areas, and with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations. Review 3 also rates the paper as technically solid, with high impact on at least one sub-area, or moderate-to-high impact on more than one areas, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations. Both reviews note the significance of the paper in providing best-of-both-worlds guarantees for bandit model selection and extending the idea of regret balancing to the adversarial environment.

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews and your assessment, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I am concerned about the weaknesses mentioned in Review 1. How confident are you in the paper's evaluation and resources?

Dialogue agent: Review 2 and Review 3 both rate the evaluation and resources as good-to-excellent. However, as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation. I can only present the reviews and their ratings.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Thank you for your help. Based on the reviews, I will accept the paper "Best of Both Worlds Model Selection".
