 Sure, I'd be happy to help! As a dialogue agent, I will respond to the reviewer's questions based on the information provided in the paper.

Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing your paper on the new Rademacher complexity bounds for deep neural networks. I have a few questions. Firstly, could you explain why you chose to focus on long papers only?

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for your question. We focused on long papers because we wanted to evaluate the importance of reviewer confidence in accepting or rejecting papers. Long papers are typically more comprehensive and rigorous in their analyses, which makes them more suitable for assessing the effectiveness of our bounds.

Reviewer: That makes sense. Can you tell me more about your bounds and how they relate to existing literature?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly! Our bounds are based on the Rademacher complexity of the function class defined by the network architecture, which includes convolutional and skip connections. Previous literature has focused on bounds for individual layers or specific architectures, but our bounds are more general and apply to a wider range of deep neural networks. We also provide a comparison to existing literature and demonstrate the advantages of our bounds.

Reviewer: I see. How do your bounds relate to the state of the art in terms of excess capacity in neural networks?

Dialogue Agent: Our bounds provide a more accurate measure of excess capacity in neural networks compared to previous literature. We show that constrained models with lower group norm and Lipschitz capacity terms can achieve similar performance to unconstrained models with excess capacity, while having similar capacity on increasingly difficult tasks. This indicates that, like with parameter counts, neural networks are compressible w.r.t. weight norms.

Reviewer: That's interesting. Can you tell me more about your experiments and how you address the limitations of normalization techniques in the network?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! Our experiments are based on training a modified ResNet-18 model without batch normalization across the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet classification datasets. We address the limitations of normalization techniques by not relying on them in our bounds. Our bounds are based on the Rademacher complexity of the function class defined by the network architecture, which includes convolutional and skip connections.

Reviewer: I see. How do your bounds relate to the state of the art in terms of neural network architectures and normalization techniques?
