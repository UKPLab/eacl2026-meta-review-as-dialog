Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent, I would like to discuss the reviews for the paper titled "Active Ranking without Strong Stochastic Transitivity." Can you provide me with an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. Review 1 highlighted the clear contributions and operational details of the paper, but noted a limitation in the lack of evidence of how the algorithm works on real-world data. Review 2 focused on the unique and clever sample complexity analysis, but expressed concerns over the algorithm's complexity and the need for a stronger ordering than epsilon-ranking. Review 3 praised the paper's relevance and novel algorithmic solution, but pointed out minor weaknesses and typos and expressed doubts about the final step of the authors' lower bound conjecture.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, I see that the paper has clear strengths, but also limitations and weaknesses that should be considered. Review 1's concern about the lack of real-world evidence is important, but the paper's contributions and operational details are still noteworthy. Review 2's concerns about the algorithm's complexity and the need for a stronger ordering than epsilon-ranking are valid, but in my view, the importance of establishing bounds for exact ranking under WST justifies accepting the paper. Review 3's praise for the paper's relevance and novel algorithmic solution is encouraging, but I agree that the weaknesses and typos should be addressed, and the final step of the conjecture should be proven if possible.

Dialogue agent: Understood. I should also note that the paper is a long type and received a rating of 7 for accept from all three reviewers, with confidence scores ranging from 3 to 4.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that information. I will take into consideration the high ratings and confidence scores, but ultimately, I will need to weigh the importance of reviewer concerns and limitations against the strengths of the paper before making a final decision on whether to accept or reject it.
