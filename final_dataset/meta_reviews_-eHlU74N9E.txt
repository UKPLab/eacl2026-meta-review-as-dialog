Meta-reviewer: Hello, I have read the reviews for the paper "Causal Inference with Non-IID Data using Linear Graphical Models" and I would like to discuss some points with you regarding them. Can you please provide me with some information about the paper and its reviews?

Dialogue agent: Of course, I would be happy to help. The paper is a long-format submission that studies causal inference problems with non-IID data under linear graphical models. It proposes conditions under which ignoring interference results in negligible bias and presents a linear regression method to estimate causal effects. The reviews are generally positive, although some reviewers have pointed out some weaknesses and areas for improvement.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the brief summary. Could you elaborate on the main strengths of the paper according to the reviews?

Dialogue agent: Sure. According to review 2, the problem studied in the paper is very interesting and meaningful because it addresses a common issue in real-world problems. The paper is also original, and the authors show theoretical results on detecting and quantifying interaction bias. Review 3 similarly highlights that the paper is well-written and addresses a very interesting statistical problem relevant to many fields.

Meta-reviewer: I see. And what about the weaknesses?

Dialogue agent: One weakness pointed out by review 1 is that the paper introduces too many terminologies, which can make the main idea difficult to grasp. Review 2 also mentions that the writing needs improvement and that some of the notation is inconsistent. Additionally, review 3 notes that the interaction bias formula assumes that the root node must be known in a real dataset, which may not be realistic in many use cases. The reviewers also suggest that more experimental studies and comparisons with other ATE methods would be helpful.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on these reviews, I am inclined to accept the paper, but I do have some concerns regarding the confidence levels of the reviewers. Review 1 has a low confidence level, which suggests that the assessment may not be completely accurate. How important is the confidence level in making a decision?

Dialogue agent: The confidence level reflects the reviewer's level of certainty in their assessment. In general, it is considered more reliable to rely on reviews with a higher confidence level. However, even reviews with lower confidence levels can provide valuable feedback and insights, especially if multiple reviewers highlight similar points.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Given this information, I am still inclined to accept the paper as the reviewers have generally provided positive feedback and the weaknesses can be addressed in revisions. Thank you for your help in clarifying the reviews.
