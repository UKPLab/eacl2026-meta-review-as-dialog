Meta-Reviewer: Hello dialogue agent, I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "Learning Invariant Representations for Reinforcement Learning without Reconstruction." Can you briefly describe the paper's approach and contributions?

Dialogue Agent: The paper proposes a method for robust representation learning of observations for reinforcement learning. The authors train a model to align the Euclidean distance between two observations with bisimulation metrics, which quantify how similar the states that generated the observations are in terms of the control problem. This reduces the effect of irrelevant features in the observations on the representations. The authors call this approach Deep Bisimulation Control (DBC), and they demonstrate its effectiveness in experiments on the DeepMind Control Suite and the CARLA simulator. Key contributions include theoretical analysis with generalization guarantees, comparative evaluation with multiple strong state-of-the-art models, and the presentation of results on both continuous deep actor-critic methods and standard RL algorithms.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Review 1 recommends acceptance with a rating of 7 and a confidence of 4. Can you comment on why the reviewer raised concerns about the example of weather affecting autonomous driving and asked for insight on why DBC fails to beat contrastive learning in Figure 4?

Dialogue Agent: While the reviewer raises valid concerns about the example, the point being made is still clear, and the paper could consider using a different example in future revisions. As for Figure 4, the paper aims to learn robust representations for the natural setting, and while the contrastive approach performs better on this particular task, DBC outperforms all other methods when a significant number of distractors are present. The paper could include additional analysis to provide more insight into how this may be addressed in future versions of DBC.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 2 recommends acceptance with a rating of 7 and a slightly lower confidence of 3. Can you comment on why the reviewer would have liked to see DBC combined with another model-free or model-based algorithm and more instances of task generalization?

Dialogue Agent: While the paper presents good evidence of the effectiveness of DBC on various benchmarks, adding additional experiments with other algorithms would certainly strengthen the paper's claims. Additionally, the paper could consider providing more instances of task generalization to further demonstrate the method's ability to learn task-specific representations. Overall, Review 2 provides valuable feedback but suggests a strong accept recommendation.

Meta-Reviewer: Review 3 recommends a strong accept rating of 9 and has a high confidence of 5. Can you address the minor concerns raised about computational load, small figures, and notation ambiguity?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The paper could provide additional information on the computational load associated with the approach. The paper could also consider enlarging key figures to make them more readable. As for notation ambiguity, the paper mostly deals with a fully observable world, and the sections are relatively consistent in their definitions. However, the paper could clarify minor inconsistencies between definitions and descriptions. Overall, Review 3 recommends a strong accept with very little constructive criticism. 

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the comments Dialogue Agent. Overall, the three reviews are positive, and the paper's contributions are clear and well-supported. I recommend a strong accept with a rating of 8 and a confidence of 4.
