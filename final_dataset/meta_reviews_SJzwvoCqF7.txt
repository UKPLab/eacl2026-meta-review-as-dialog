Meta-reviewer: Good afternoon, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "On Tighter Generalization Bounds for Deep Neural Networks: CNNs, ResNets, and Beyond." Can you give me an overview of the paper's contribution?

Dialogue agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. The paper proposes a generalization bound for deep neural networks based on the dimensions of the network, rather than norms. The authors derive this bound by controlling the Rademacher complexity of the Ramp loss under the Lipschitzness of the network as a parametric function in Depth * Width^2 number of parameters. They extend this technique for several types of specialized neural networks, including CNNs and ResNets, and provide specialized bounds for each case. The paper also includes comparisons to existing bounds in the literature.

Meta-reviewer: I see. One of the reviewers mentioned that there is already literature on dimension-dependent bounds like this. Is this a problem?

Dialogue agent: While it is true that adaptive, completely norm-dependent bounds may be better than explicit dimension-dependent bounds, the contribution of this paper lies in the specialized bounds for different types of neural networks. Additionally, the comparison in Figure 1 and Table 2 is not fair since they are comparing the specialized bounds for CNNs to generic bounds for standard feedforward networks.

Meta-reviewer: That makes sense. Another reviewer mentioned some concerns about the vacuity of the bound. What can you say about this?

Dialogue agent: The authors do address this concern in their response to the reviews. They argue that the bound is not vacuous and provide some supporting evidence. However, this remains an open question and further investigation is needed.

Meta-reviewer: Okay. One reviewer also suggested that the paper failed to compare fairly with recent work by Arora et al. and Zhou and Feng. How do the authors respond to this?

Dialogue agent: The authors argued in their response that the norms of weight matrices are more interpretable than error-resilience parameters used in the other works. As for Zhou and Feng's work, they claim that their comparison is not fair because Zhou and Feng only consider the case of one fixed network structure, while they consider several types of specialized neural networks.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Lastly, one reviewer recommended some improvements to the paper, including considering low-rankness of weight matrices and providing justification for the assumption of orthogonal filters in CNN. Did the authors address these concerns?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the authors address these concerns in their response to the reviews. They claim that the paper's bounds are already tight for low-rank weight matrices, so there is no need to consider low-rankness explicitly. As for the assumption of orthogonal filters in CNN, they argue that this is common in the literature and provides a simpler analysis. They also explain why they did not include Zhou and Feng's work in Table 2.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your responses, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews and your explanations, I am inclined to accept the paper. However, I am also concerned about the low confidence of Reviewer 1. Can you provide me with more information to help me make the final decision?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 gives a rating of "5: Marginally below acceptance threshold" and a confidence level of "3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct." However, the reviewer does not raise any major concerns and only points out some minor errors and possible improvements. On the other hand, Reviewer 2 and 3 both give a rating of "7: Good paper, accept" and express confidence levels of "4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct." Based on the overall evaluation and feedback, I would recommend accepting the paper.
