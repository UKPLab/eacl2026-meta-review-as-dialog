Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I am the meta-reviewer for the paper titled "Learning a Neural-network-based Representation for Open Set Recognition." Can you tell me a little about the reviews for this paper?

Dialogue agent: Sure. There are three reviews in total, and they all address various aspects of the paper. Review 1 discusses the novelty and persuasiveness of the proposed model, while Review 2 suggests that the paper's innovation is low and recommends the authors include comparative results on larger datasets. Finally, Review 3 focuses on the embedding learning approach and suggests that the authors compare their method with other embedding learning methods with the same outlier detection score.

Meta-reviewer: Hmm, interesting. What type of paper is this?

Dialogue agent: This is a long paper that proposes a neural-network-based model for open set recognition via finding a better feature space where larger inter-class and smaller intra-class distances are satisfied.

Meta-reviewer: And are you aware of any potential issues with the reviewers' confidence in their evaluations?

Dialogue agent: The reviewers appear to be relatively confident in their evaluations, with Review 1 and Review 2 rating the paper as "Ok but not good enough - rejection" with a confidence of 4, while Review 3 rates the paper as "Marginally below acceptance threshold" with a confidence of 5.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, what would you recommend I do regarding the paper?

Dialogue agent: As a dialogue agent, my role is to provide you with information and not to provide recommendations. However, I can tell you that the reviewers raise valid concerns about the paper's novelty and the need for comparative results on larger datasets. It may be helpful to address these concerns in any revision of the paper.
