Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have reviewed three reviews for the paper titled "Rethinking Resolution in the Context of Efficient Video Recognition". Please provide me with additional information on the paper and its reviews.

Dialogue Agent: Hello, meta-reviewer. Certainly, the paper proposes to improve efficient video recognition on low-resolution frames by using cross-resolution knowledge distillation (ResKD). The student network with shallower architecture and lower-resolution frames is guided by a teacher network with deeper architecture and higher-resolution inputs. ResKD narrows the performance gap between efficient model and large model, and this is validated by experiments conducted on several public video recognition datasets. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the summary. I see that Review 1 raises concerns about the novelty of ResKD. Is it true that this technique is not new and has been previously proposed for video recognition using knowledge distillation?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 notes that knowledge distillation has been previously used for video recognition, but ResKD specifically distills knowledge between networks with different input frame resolutions. While this approach has been proposed in a previous paper, the paper still demonstrates empirical evidence of ResKD's effectiveness. 

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Review 3 also mentions concerns about the novelty of the proposed technique and its relationship with other techniques. Can you elaborate more on that?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, Review 3 also notes that ResKD adopts a typical knowledge distillation framework and lacks novelty to some extent. Additionally, the section 3 of the paper appears to be trivial and not closely related to ResKD. However, the paper still presents a good empirical study and provides evidence of the effectiveness of the ResKD framework.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Based on these reviews, it seems that the paper is technically solid, but may lack novelty. Furthermore, Review 1 raises concerns about limited evaluation, while Review 3 notes that some experimental conditions are not clearly described. Can you provide any insights on these issues?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, Review 1 did note that the technical contribution of the paper is limited, while Review 3 noted that some experimental conditions are not clear. However, both reviews commented on the effectiveness of ResKD, and the paper does provide extensive experimental validation of the method. 

Meta-reviewer: That's helpful. Finally, Review 1 rates the paper as borderline reject while Review 2 and Review 3 rate it as weak accept. Can you provide any additional information on the ratings?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 rated the paper as borderline reject due to concerns about limited evaluation, while Review 2 and Review 3 rated it as weak accept based on the technical solidity of the paper and its moderate-to-high impact. It is ultimately up to the meta-reviewer to weigh the pros and cons of the reviews and determine whether to accept or reject the paper. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the information. Based on these reviews, I believe the paper could be accepted with minor revisions. I appreciate the dialogue and your assistance. 

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome, meta-reviewer. Let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.
