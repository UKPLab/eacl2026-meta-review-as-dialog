 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Active Learning with Partial Feedback":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hello, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Active Learning with Partial Feedback". Can you tell me about the paper's main contributions and findings?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper introduces a new active learning setting where the learner receives partial labels instead of true labels for training. The authors propose three sampling strategies based on existing active learning insights and show that their proposed approach outperforms baselines on predictive accuracy under a limited budget.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the main strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper's main strengths include its novel setting and proposed sampling strategies, which lead to improved predictive accuracy compared to baselines. However, the authors acknowledge that the lack of theoretical guarantees is a minor concern.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the lack of theoretical guarantees? Is this a significant weakness?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that providing theoretical guarantees for their approach would be valuable, but they do not consider it a major concern as their focus is on introducing a new active learning setting. The paper's experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, but the lack of theoretical guarantees may be a drawback for some readers.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: I see. What about the paper's experimental setup and results? Do the authors provide sufficient detail and analysis?

Dialogue Agent: The authors provide a detailed description of their experimental setup, including the datasets used and the neural network architecture. They also present a thorough analysis of their results, including a comparison to baselines and an examination of the impact of different parameters on performance. The experimental results appear to be well-designed and well-executed.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: That's good to know. Are there any specific areas where the authors could improve or expand upon in future work?

Dialogue Agent: The authors mention that providing theoretical guarantees for their approach would be valuable, and some readers may find this a significant weakness. Additionally, the paper's focus is on the proposed active learning setting, and some readers may wish for more discussion on the theoretical foundations of the approach or its potential applications.

Turn 6:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for the summary. Based on the information you've provided, I think I have a good understanding of the paper's contributions and limitations. What is your recommendation for the paper's acceptance?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews and the paper's content, I recommend accepting the paper with a confidence rating of 4. The paper introduces a novel active learning setting and proposes effective sampling strategies, and its experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. While some readers may wish for more theoretical foundations or applications, the paper's strengths outweigh its weaknesses.
