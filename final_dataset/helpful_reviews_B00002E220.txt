Buyer: Hi, I'm interested in purchasing Last of the Dogmen on DVD. Can you tell me a little bit about it?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly. Last of the Dogmen is a Western adventure movie in which Tom Berenger plays a bounty hunter looking for three escaped prisoners. Along the way, he discovers a hidden civilization of Cheyenne Indians and becomes embroiled in their culture.

Buyer: That sounds really interesting. Can you tell me anything about the scenery or the music in the movie?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, many of the reviews mention the scenery as being fantastic. There are scenes set in remote mountains and forests that are visually stunning. As for the music, it's been praised in a few reviews as well. 

Buyer: Do you happen to know if there are any bonus features on the DVD? I always like to have a little something extra to watch.

Dialogue Agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have access to that information. As a neutral dialog agent, I don't make recommendations or express opinions. However, I can tell you that some reviewers mention that the DVD version has good sound quality.

Buyer: That's good to know. Is the movie based on a true story?

Dialogue Agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have access to that information either. However, one reviewer mentions that the movie has a "touch of fantasy," which might imply that it's not strictly based on historical fact.

Buyer: Okay, thank you for your help. I think I'll go ahead and purchase the DVD.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome. I hope you enjoy the movie!
