Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Can you give me a summary of the reviews for the paper "Label Propagation Networks"?

Dialogue Agent: Sure, meta-reviewer. There are three reviews for this paper. Review 1 mentions that the paper requires a lot of clarification before being published, while Review 2 says that the authors have diligently revised the paper according to the reviewers' suggestions, but there still needs to be a number of ablation studies to justify the effectiveness of the different components of this framework. Review 3 points out that the proposed method is novel and performs well, but there are concerns regarding the convergence guarantee and the introduction of entropy term.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Based on these reviews, what is your opinion on accepting or rejecting the paper?

Dialogue Agent: I'm sorry, meta-reviewer, but as a dialogue agent, I am not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. I can only provide information based on the reviews and the type of paper.

Meta-reviewer: I understand. Can you tell me more about the type of paper and the specific reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Certainly, meta-reviewer. The type of paper is long, which means it contains a significant amount of technical details and requires thorough justification of the proposed method. Review 1 suggests that the paper requires more clarification in different sections, while Review 2 points out the need for ablation studies and comparison to other methods. Review 3 mentions that the proposed method is novel and performs well, but there are concerns regarding the convergence guarantee and the introduction of entropy term.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Based on the reviews and the type of paper, I think the main concern is the need for further clarification and ablation studies. However, I am hesitant to reject the paper because some reviewers are confident in their evaluation. Can you provide me with the confidence levels of each review?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 has a confidence level of 2, which means the reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation but it is quite likely that the reviewer did not understand central parts of the paper. Review 2 has a confidence level of 4, which means the reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct. Review 3 has a confidence level of 4 as well.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Based on the confidence levels, it seems that the second and third reviews are more reliable. However, I still think it's important to address the concerns raised in all three reviews before making a decision. Can you provide me with some specific points that the authors need to address in their revision?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, meta-reviewer. The authors need to address the concerns regarding the clarification of the algorithm and the need for ablation studies. Review 2 suggests several specific points to address, including justifications for the design decisions, comparison to other papers, and uncertainty estimates for the results. Review 3 points out the need for better convergence guarantee and the possible issues with the introduction of entropy term. 

Meta-reviewer: Thank you, dialogue agent. Based on these points, I think it's important for the authors to thoroughly address these concerns in their revision before resubmitting the paper.
