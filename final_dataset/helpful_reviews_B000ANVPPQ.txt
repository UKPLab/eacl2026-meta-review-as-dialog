Buyer: Hi, I’m interested in purchasing McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition), but I’d like to know more about it before I make a decision. Can you give me some information about the plot and the quality of the DVD?

Dialogue Agent: The McLintock! (Authentic Collector's Edition) is a Western comedy film starring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara. As per reviews, this is considered as one of the best Wayne/O'Hara films.

Buyer: Is this version of the movie better than others that are available?

Dialogue Agent: Yes, according to reviews, this is the best copy of the movie that they have found. The transfer is from original film elements, and in anamorphic 2.35 Panavision widescreen. The DVD extras are also plentiful and informative.

Buyer: Can you tell me more about the quality of the DVD?

Dialogue Agent: The quality of this DVD is superb, with a crisp clear picture and very good audio. Fans of John Wayne can rejoice as there is now a quality version available.

Buyer: Is the movie more of a Western or a comedy?

Dialogue Agent: The movie is hailed as a comedy, but it is also considered as one of the best westerns John Wayne ever did. However predictable, there is a lot of fun along the way with a rather silly plot about the "indians" thrown in for good measure.

Buyer: I’m not familiar with the actors in this movie. Can you tell me more about the supporting cast?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. The movie features a strong supporting cast including Stefanie Powers as daughter Rebbecca, Patrick Wayne as Dev Warren, Yvonne DeCarlo as Louise Warren, Chill Wills as Drago, Strother Martin as Agard, and Jerry Van Dyke as Matt Douglas, Jr, among others.

Buyer: Thanks for the information. I think I’ll go ahead and make the purchase.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome. Happy viewing!
