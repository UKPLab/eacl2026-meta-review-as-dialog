 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper titled "Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network for Multi-evidence Question Answering":

Turn 1:

Meta-Reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper titled "Coarse-grain Fine-grain Coattention Network for Multi-evidence Question Answering". Can you help me understand the main idea of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper proposes a coarse-grain fine-grain coattention network architecture for multi-evidence question answering. The coarse-grained module reads all of the supporting documents for QA, while the fine-grained one reads the local context surrounding each candidate entity's mentions. The final result is the sum of the two scores.

Turn 2:

Meta-Reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to Review 1, the paper achieves a new state of the art on the Qangaroo multi-hop QA dataset and presents a clear and well-written paper with solid results and meaningful ablation studies. Review 2 also mentions that the paper achieves state-of-the-art results without the use of pretrained contextualized embeddings and that the coarse-grain fine-grain coattention network architecture is a novel approach.

Turn 3:

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me about the weaknesses of the paper, according to the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: According to Review 2, the paper lacks motivation about the designs of the coarse and fine scoring models, and the novelty of the approach is not very clear. Review 3 also mentions that the paper is lacking in generalizability and that the proposed approach is a general architecture for multiple-choice datasets requiring multiple evidence, and suggests further experiments on other benchmarks.

Turn 4:

Meta-Reviewer: Based on the reviews, do you think the paper is acceptable or should be rejected?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper has both strengths and weaknesses. The reviews are generally positive, but there are some concerns about the motivation and generalizability of the approach. Without more information, it is difficult for me to make a final decision.

Turn 5:

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your help. I will consider the information you provided and make a final decision based on my own expertise and judgement.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! I'm here to help if you have any other questions.
