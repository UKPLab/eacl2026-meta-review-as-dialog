Meta-reviewer: Hello, thank you for joining this meeting. I have read the reviews for the paper "Consensus Clustering with Unsupervised Representation Learning", and I must say that I have some concerns about accepting it. 

Dialogue agent: Thank you for having me. I understand that you have some concerns. How can I assist you?

Meta-reviewer: First of all, one of the reviewers mentioned that the cited literature on consensus clustering is outdated, and I am not convinced that the paper captures the state of the art. Can you provide any additional information on this?

Dialogue agent: As an AI language model, I am not allowed to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can confirm that Reviewer 1 suggested that the authors should consider comparing their method with the state of the art on consensus clustering which is not deep learning based.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Another issue that was raised is that the description of the algorithm is often too vague and fragmented, and the flow that brings them together is unclear. Can you clarify this?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 1 mentioned that several steps and settings are ad-hoc and not well-motivated, and provided examples, such as the choice of using a multi-layer perceptron to further reduce feature vectors. Reviewer 1 also asked for clarification on the process of generating two views of the input images and why 2 views were used instead of 3 or more. 

Meta-reviewer: Alright. I also have a concern over the quality of the experiments. One reviewer mentioned that it is hard to conclude that the proposed algorithm has a significant advantage over state of the art methods, especially PICA. Can you provide any additional information on this?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 2 suggested that using the performance metrics provided by the authors, it is hard to conclude that the proposed algorithm has a significant advantage over state of the art methods. Reviewer 2 also stated that the fluctuation in performance metrics caused by different parameter settings seems to be at least comparable to the margin of the proposed algorithm over the baselines.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the explanation. On the other hand, one reviewer mentioned that the authors proposed a reasonable idea and the method seems sound. Can you please provide more details on this?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 3 stated that the authors proposed a learning-based approach for image clustering and used a similar approach to that proposed in Zhuang et al., ICCV'19 for unsupervised learning of visual embeddings, which targets clustering tasks and uses cluster ensembles to improve training robustness. However, the authors proposed to generate 2 clusterings of the images at every iteration by applying different sets of data augmentations and feature transformations to the input images, and to enforce consistency between them over time, thus improving representation invariance to irrelevant image details. In an experimental evaluation on a set of standard image clustering benchmarks, the authors outperform prior work in most scenarios.

Meta-reviewer: Interesting. However, Reviewer 3 also mentioned that the authors seemed to be not aware of the work by Zhuang et al. Can you explain this?

Dialogue agent: Reviewer 3 stated that the authors seem to have missed the point that Zhuang et al. had already combined consensus clustering with representation learning, but used different runs of the clustering algorithm to obtain diverse clusterings instead of transforming the images. Reviewer 3 suggested that the authors provide a discussion of their novelty with respect to that method as well as an experimental comparison on ImageNet.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Thank you for the summary. Based on these reviews, how confident are you with the evaluation of the paper?

Dialogue agent: I am an AI language model and as such, am not capable of giving opinions or evaluations. However, Reviewer 1 is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the relevant literature, while Reviewer 2 is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your assistance. I will examine these reviews more closely before making a final decision.
