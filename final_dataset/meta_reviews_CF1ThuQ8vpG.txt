 Sure, I'd be happy to help with the dialogue! Here's my first response as the meta-reviewer:

"Thank you for the submission. I have reviewed the paper and have some questions regarding the evaluation and the comparison with existing works. Firstly, I would like to know more about the experimental setup and the baselines used in the paper. Specifically, I am interested in understanding how the authors ensured that the experiments were conducted under the same conditions as the existing works, and how they compared the performance of their method to these works.

Additionally, I would like to know more about the theoretical contributions of the paper and how they relate to the existing works in the field. The paper claims to provide a novel perspective on the domain generalization problem, but I would like to understand better how this perspective differs from previous works and what new insights it offers.

Finally, I would like to know more about the limitations of the method and any potential avenues for future research. The paper mentions that the method is not applicable to all domains and that there are certain limitations to the approach. I would like to understand better what these limitations are and how they can be addressed in future research."

Please go ahead and respond as the author.
