 Sure, here is a multi-turn dialogue between a meta-reviewer and a dialogue agent for reviews about a paper:

Turn 1:

Meta-reviewer: Hi, I'm reviewing a paper called "CODA: A Design Assistant to Facilitate Specifying Constraints and Parametric Behavior in CAD Models". Can you help me understand the main contribution of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure! The paper presents an interactive software tool for facilitating the design process of CAD models by proposing constraints to novice users. The tool is available as a plugin for Autodesk Fusion 360.

Turn 2:

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with an extensive overview of the related work. The problem that is being addressed is interesting and useful, and the implementation and workflow are well explained. The main contribution of the paper seems to be an intuitive user interface for CAD modeling.

Turn 3:

Meta-reviewer: What are the weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: One reviewer felt that the presented examples look too simplistic, and it would be good to show a more complex sketch. Another reviewer was concerned about the scalability of the interface to more complex models, and the lack of formal evaluation of the tool's usability.

Turn 4:

Meta-reviewer: How do the reviews differ?

Dialogue Agent: The reviews differ in their assessment of the novelty of the approach and the effectiveness of the presented examples. One reviewer found the paper to be well-done and useful, while another reviewer felt that the novelty of the approach is limited and the presented examples are too simplistic.

Turn 5:

Meta-reviewer: Based on the reviews, how would you summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the paper?

Dialogue Agent: The paper presents an intuitive user interface for CAD modeling, with a well-written and easy-to-follow presentation of the related work. However, the presented examples are too simplistic and the lack of formal evaluation of the tool's usability is a concern.

Turn 6:

Meta-reviewer: How do you think the paper should be evaluated?

Dialogue Agent: Based on the reviews, the paper should be evaluated as marginally above acceptance threshold, with a confidence level of 4. The main contribution of the paper is the intuitive user interface for CAD modeling, but the lack of formal evaluation and the limited novelty of the approach are concerns.
