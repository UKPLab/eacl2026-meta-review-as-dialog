Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your reviews. It seems like we have a paper on our hands that proposes a novel approach for graph similarity computation with a reduced computation burden. Reviewer 1 and 2 both have positive comments and propose a rating of weak accept with a confidence of 6. Reviewer 3, however, is a bit more critical and suggests a borderline accept rating with a confidence of 5. 

Dialogue Agent: Yes, that's correct. The paper proposes a new method for computing graph similarity, which involves a neural model that reduces the computation burden from a node-to-node to a node-to-graph similarity computation. The proposed method is shown to be efficient and effective through experiments.

Meta-Reviewer: Can you tell me more about the strengths and weaknesses highlighted by the reviewers? 

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer 1 highlights the technical correctness of the model and the experiments. However, they note that the derivation of the necessary conditions for computing GED is somewhat conceptual and suggest including more mathematical derivations. Reviewer 2 compliments the well-structured paper and novel approach to computing GED in the embedding space. However, they suggest including more discussion on the social value or limitations of the proposed method. Reviewer 3 notes that the proposed method is intuitive and competitive with other baselines in terms of accuracy and inference speed. However, they have some technical questions and suggest more analysis on the key parameter $\lambda$.

Meta-Reviewer: I see. Reviewer confidence was also noted for each review. How should I weigh the confidence level of the reviews in my decision-making process for acceptance or rejection?

Dialogue Agent: Reviewer confidence is an important factor to consider, as it reflects how certain the reviewer is of their assessment. However, it is ultimately up to your discretion as the meta-reviewer to weigh the importance of reviewer confidence in your decision-making process.

Meta-Reviewer: Understood. Thank you for your help. Based on these reviews, I feel comfortable accepting this paper.
