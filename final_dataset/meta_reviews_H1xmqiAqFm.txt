 Sure, here is a simulated dialogue between a dialogue agent and a meta-reviewer assessing a paper for acceptance or rejection:

Dialogue Agent: Hello! I'm here to help you assess the paper "Investigating CNNs Learning Representation under label noise". Can you please tell me what you think of the paper so far?

Meta-Reviewer: Well, I have some mixed feelings about it. The authors challenge the CNNs robustness to label noise, but when the label noise is class dependent, more realistic scenario than class independent noise. I think the analysis is sound and addresses interesting points, giving insightful results. However, the overall conclusion is not very surprising, and there is no significant novelty in the paper.

Dialogue Agent: I see. Based on your feedback, I can summarize the reviews as follows: Review 1 suggests that the paper is generally well-written and well-structured, but the overall conclusion is not very surprising and there is no significant novelty in the paper. Review 2 highlights several points that are not comprehensively studied and analyzed, such as providing more direct and solid proofs on the relationship between conceptual and visual distances between class dependent labels. Review 3 praises the authors for finding a new angle to exploit robust learning with noisy labels, but questions the definition of realistic label noise and suggests that the setting and conclusion should be reasonable.

Meta-Reviewer: Yes, that's correct. I gave the paper a rating of 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold and confidence of 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for sharing your feedback with me. Based on the reviews, it seems that the paper is well-written and addresses interesting points, but lacks significant novelty and the overall conclusion is not very surprising. Additionally, there are some points that are not comprehensively studied and analyzed. Would you like me to summarize the reviews in a different way or provide any additional information?

Meta-Reviewer: No, that's fine. I think you've summarized the reviews well. I'm just not sure if the paper is quite groundbreaking enough to warrant publication.

Dialogue Agent: Understood. Based on your feedback, I would recommend that the paper be considered for publication with a marginally below acceptance threshold. However, I would also suggest that the authors address the points raised by the reviewers and provide more comprehensive analysis to support their conclusions.

Meta-Reviewer: Agreed. Thank you for your help in assessing this paper.

Dialogue Agent: You're welcome! Is there anything else you would like me to assist you with?
