Meta-Reviewer: Thank you, Dialogue Agent, for joining me today. I have reviewed the three reviews for the paper "Learning Neural Random Fields with Inclusive Auxiliary Generators" and I would like to discuss the paper's strengths and weaknesses.

Dialogue Agent: Thank you for having me. I am glad to help in any way I can.

Meta-Reviewer: Let's start with Review 1. The reviewer finds the paper to be well written and the experiments to be convincing, especially the synthetic data experiments. However, the theoretical contribution seems weak as some of the ideas are not new. What do you think about this?

Dialogue Agent: As a dialogue agent, I am not permitted to provide opinions or recommendations. However, I can confirm that the authors have used SGLD/SGHMC to revise samples drawn from the auxiliary generator and these two sampling methods are examined theoretically. They have also provided some theoretical analysis of SGLD/SGHMC. 

Meta-Reviewer: Alright. Now, Review 2 finds the approach sound and well-evaluated. However, the reviewer would have liked some more background and explicit description and contrast compared to the explicit NRF. Moreover, the reviewer is not entirely clear about the "Generation IS" vs "Revision IS" column in Table 4 and Section 4.4. Can you help me with this?

Dialogue Agent: Again, as a dialogue agent, I cannot provide opinions or recommendations. But I can state that the proposed method is evaluated on various datasets for unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised learning problems. As for "Generation IS" vs "Revision IS" column, "generation" is the initial sampling of x=g(h), and "revision" is the application of gradient revision. However, I will request more information from the authors regarding the differences in these columns.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for that clarification. Finally, Review 3 is concerned about the lack of substantial contribution of the proposed method compared to existing works. The reviewer also questions the claim of better mode exploration and finds the experimental results to be marginally better or comparable to existing methods. Can you comment on this?

Dialogue Agent: While I cannot provide opinions or recommendations, I can confirm that the authors' proposed method differs from existing works due to the use of inclusive-divergence minimization for the generative model and the use of SGLD/SGHMC for sampling. The authors have also explained why their proposed method helps in better mode exploration. However, I will request more information from the authors to better address these concerns.

Meta-Reviewer: Thank you for your response. I will consider all of these reviews and your input before making the final decision to accept or reject the paper.
