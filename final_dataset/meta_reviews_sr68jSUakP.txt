Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. Thank you for joining me today to discuss the reviews for the paper "Orthogonal Subspace Decomposition: A New Perspective of Learning Discriminative Features for Face Clustering". Can you provide me with a summary of the reviews for this paper?

Dialogue agent: Sure. There were three reviews for this paper. Review 1 expressed concern regarding the novelty of the proposed method and suggested that the influence of different combinations of the loss subterms should be analyzed. Review 2 complimented the paper's attempt to leverage subspace learning and proposed space reconstruction loss, but had concerns regarding the equal weighting of the loss terms. Finally, Review 3 praised the proposed OSD module and the comparison with state-of-the-art methods but was concerned about the lack of generality of the module and its applicability to other frameworks.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for summarizing the reviews. From what I understand, there are some concerns, but overall, the paper presents promising results. Can you tell me more about the type and length of the paper?

Dialogue agent: Yes, the paper is of type long, and it is relatively lengthy.

Meta-reviewer: Okay, that makes sense. Given the reviewers' comments and the type of paper, how confident are you that the paper is worth accepting for publication?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, Review 1 rated a 4 and recommended rejection, Review 2 rated a 7 and recommended acceptance, and Review 3 rated a 5 and suggested the paper was marginally below the acceptance threshold. Therefore, I cannot provide an opinion or recommendation, but I can present the reviewers' ratings and comments.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for sticking to the guidelines. I appreciate the information you've provided so far. We need to reach a decision on whether to accept or reject this paper. One of the key factors we need to consider is the confidence of the reviewers. Can you tell me more about the reviewers' confidence levels?

Dialogue agent: Sure. Review 1 and Review 3 were fairly confident in their evaluations, with confidence levels of 4 and 5, respectively. Review 2 was less confident, with a confidence level of 3.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that information. Based on the reviewers' ratings and comments, their confidence levels, and the type and length of the paper, I am inclined to accept this paper for publication. However, I am curious about the concerns raised by the reviewers, particularly regarding the novelty of the proposed method and the equal weighting of the loss terms. Can you tell me more about these concerns and how they might impact our decision?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 expressed concern about the novelty, suggesting that the authors should highlight the motivations and contributions of the proposed method that are different from other methods. Review 2 was concerned about the equal weighting of the loss terms, suggesting that it is unreasonable to assign equal weights to different terms. These concerns could impact our decision, as they indicate areas where the paper could be improved. However, it is up to you to weigh the importance of these concerns and decide whether they are significant enough to reject the paper.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that analysis. I will consider these concerns and weigh them against the strengths of the paper. Overall, I am inclined to accept this paper for publication, given its promising results and the overall positive reception by the reviewers. However, I will ask the authors to address the concerns raised by the reviewers in their revisions. Thank you for your help today, dialogue agent.
