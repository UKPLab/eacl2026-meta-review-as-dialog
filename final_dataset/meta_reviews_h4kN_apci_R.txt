Meta-reviewer: Hello there. I have read through the reviews of the paper titled "Probabilistic Missing Value Imputation for Mixed Categorical and Ordered Data." Based on the reviews, I see that there are varying opinions on whether to accept or reject the paper. I would like to understand from the dialogue agent what their perspective is, based on the reviews and the type of the paper.

Dialogue agent: Hello. Based on the reviews and the type of the paper, I can tell you that the paper is long and technical, and proposes a novel and sound method for handling single and multiple imputation for mixed data. There are certain strengths highlighted by Review 1 and Review 3, such as the clarity of text and technical contributions, substantial improvement over competing methods, and addressing an important and well-defined problem. However, there are also weaknesses highlighted by Review 2 and Review 3, including the overlap with a previously published work, limitations of the proposed method, and lack of evaluation for multiple imputation.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for the overview. I would like to explore further the concerns highlighted by Review 3, specifically the overlap with a previously published work. Can you provide more information on this?

Dialogue agent: Review 3 highlights that the main contribution of the paper overlaps substantially with a previously published work "Missing Value Imputation for Mixed Data via Gaussian Copula." It suggests that the authors should discuss the added value of their new method and compare its performance with the existing one. However, Review 1 notes that the extended Gaussian copula probabilistic model using the argmax transformation is novel and represents an improvement over standard imputation methods. Therefore, it may be worth considering the significance of the novel contribution in light of the overlap with the previous work.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Another concern raised in Review 3 is the computational complexity of the method. Can you provide more information on this?

Dialogue agent: Yes, Review 3 notes that the computational complexity of the method is cubic with respect to the dimension of the latent, which could be restricting in practice. The authors propose to use a low-rank approximation of $\Sigma$, but the effect of such an approximation is not evaluated in the experimental results. This could be a limitation of the proposed method, which the authors should discuss further.

Meta-reviewer: Understood. Lastly, can you remind me of the ratings and confidence levels provided by the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: Review 1 gave a rating of 7, indicating acceptance, with a confidence level of 3. Review 2 gave a rating of 5, indicating borderline acceptance, with a confidence level of 2. Review 3 also gave a rating of 5, indicating borderline acceptance, with a higher confidence level of 4.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you. Based on the reviews and the concerns raised, I am inclined to analyze the significance of the novel contribution and the computational complexity, and make a decision on acceptance or rejection. I appreciate your input.
