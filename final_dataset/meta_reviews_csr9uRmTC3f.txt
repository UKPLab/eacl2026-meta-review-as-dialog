Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper titled "Exploring the Algorithm-Dependent Generalization of AUPRC Optimization with List Stability." Can you tell me more about the paper and its contributions?

Dialogue agent: Certainly. The paper proposes a novel framework that optimizes AUPRC in an end-to-end manner and explores the algorithm-dependent generalization of stochastic AUPRC optimization. The authors show that the objective function is asymptotically unbiased by approximation error analysis, and the proposed stochastic optimization algorithm has a generalization guarantee. Their experiments demonstrate the proposed framework works well on image retrieval datasets. The paper addresses some important theoretical issues of AUPRC optimization and proposes a useful tool to analyze the convergence/stability of compositional optimization problems.

Meta-reviewer: That sounds interesting. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the paper based on the reviews?

Dialogue agent: The paper has several strengths, including the novel framework for end-to-end AUPRC optimization, the theoretical properties of the objective function and stochastic algorithm, the generalization guarantee, and the extensive experiments. The paper also identifies the weaknesses of some previous works and proposes a semi-variance regular term to further improve the performance. However, the experiment details of the competitors need to be more specific to ensure fair comparisons. In addition, the presentation of some key techniques can be further improved.

Meta-reviewer: Would you recommend accepting the paper?

Dialogue agent: Based on the reviews, two reviewers have recommended accepting the paper with ratings of 7 and 8, respectively. The paper is technically solid and addresses important theoretical issues of AUPRC optimization. The experiments have validated the proposed method, and the limitations and potential negative societal impact have been described. Therefore, I believe the paper should be accepted.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for your response. Can you tell me more about the confidence levels of the reviewers?

Dialogue agent: The confidence levels of the reviewers vary. Reviewer 1 has a confidence level of 4 in their assessment, which means they are confident but not absolutely certain. Reviewer 2 also has a confidence level of 4 in their assessment. Reviewer 3, on the other hand, has a confidence level of 5, which means they are absolutely certain about their assessment and are very familiar with the related work.
