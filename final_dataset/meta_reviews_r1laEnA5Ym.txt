Meta-reviewer: Hello, dialogue agent. I have read the reviews for the paper "A Variational Inequality Perspective on Generative Adversarial Networks" and I am trying to decide whether to accept or reject it. Could you provide me with more information about the paper?

Dialogue Agent: Sure. This paper takes a variational inequality perspective to the study of saddle point problems that define GANs. The authors propose several methods that are variants of SGD and show that they exhibit better performance than Adam and a basic gradient method in a simple example. After demonstrating theoretical guarantees of these methods, they propose combining them with existing techniques, showing that this leads to better results.

Meta-reviewer: I see. Could you tell me more about the reviews?

Dialogue Agent: Review 1 recommends clear acceptance of the paper, praising its balance between theory and experiments and emphasizing the non-trivial nature of the results. Review 2 also recommends acceptance, highlighting the usefulness of the ideas from VIP for training GANs. Review 3 also recommends acceptance, but expresses some skepticism about the experiments on GANs and suggests that the authors release an implementation of the proposed new optimizers for practitioners to try them out.

Meta-reviewer: Thank you for that summary. Based on the reviews, it seems that there is a high level of confidence in the quality of the paper. However, I am concerned about the skepticism expressed in Review 3 regarding the experiments on GANs. Can you provide more information about those experiments?

Dialogue Agent: Review 3 states that the experiments on GANs indicate that for the specific choice of architectures and hyper-parameters, "ExtraAdam" works better, but the chosen architectures are not state-of-the-art. Review 3 suggests that the authors should release an implementation of the proposed new optimizers (ExtraAdam) for a popular DL framework (e.g. pytorch) to enable practitioners to try them out in a "plug-and-play" fashion. Review 3 also points out that the theory is presented for variational inequalities with monotone operators, while GANs parametrized with neural nets lead to non-monotone VIs. A provably convergent algorithm for that setting is still an open problem.

Meta-reviewer: I see. While I appreciate the positive evaluations of the paper, I think the skepticism expressed in Review 3 is important. Given that the paper is of the long type, it might be worth exploring the skepticism further before making a decision. I'll take that into account when making my decision. Thank you for your help.
